Acknowledgments

At various stages I thought of giving up this book. What kept
me going was the continuing challenge posed by rightwing
Hindu nationalists to the very idea and practice of secularism
and democracy in India, the encouragement of colleagues,
friends, and strangers from different parts of the world who
found my ideas interesting, and the discomfort of many “closet”
Hindu nationalists who found the same ideas unduly provocative and anti-Hindu.
I owe a debt to scholars and intellectuals who have interrogated Hindu nationalism and challenged it for more than a
century now. But this antidemocratic and antisecular movement continues unabated and this is the rationale for my intervention here.
I benefited in more ways that I can remember from my interactions with scholars and students during seminars at various venues, especially Australian National University (ANU), University
of California Berkeley (UCal Berkeley), Cardiff University, the
Central University of Hyderabad (CUH), Jawaharlal Nehru
University (JNU), the National University of Singapore, Oxford
University, and the University of Westminster.
My stay as a Beatrice M. Bain Affiliated Scholar at UCal
Berkeley (2008) and as a Freilich Visiting Fellow at the ANU
(2009) were remarkably productive. My gratitude goes to Paola
Bacchetta, Freilich Foundation, and The Research School of
Humanities at ANU. I also appreciate the opportunities afforded
by Jyotirmaya Sharma at CUH and Zoya Hasan at JNU by inviting me as a visiting fellow at their respective institutions.
Nitasha Kaul was generous with her encouragement, ideas,
and questions.

Hindu Nationalism in India

H

indutva (“Hindu-ness,” shorthand for Hindu nationalism) in India is a chauvinist and majoritarian nationalism
that conjures up the image of a peaceful Hindu Self vis-à-vis
the threatening minority Other. Hindu nationalism normalizes
a politics of fear and hatred by representing it as a defensive
reaction to the threats supposedly posed by Muslims to the
security of the individual Hindus as well as of the Hindu collective. Hindutva is porno-nationalism in its obsessive preoccupation with the predatory sexuality of the putative Muslim
figure and the dangers to the integrity of the Hindu bodies. The
proponents of Hindutva mobilize and generate negative stereotypes of Islam and Muslims to legitimize violence against actual
Muslims living in India. This book investigates myriad ways in
which the discourses of culture, insecurity, nationalism, gender,
identity, and violence intersect in Hindu nationalism’s reactionary and right-wing politics of fear and imagination. While
scholars and commentators have focused on different aspects of
Hindutva in India and within the Indian diaspora, there is no
other book-length ethnographic study of the centrality of fear,
insecurity, and imagination in the Hindu nationalist project.
In this opening chapter, I will introduce the phenomenon of
Hindu nationalism and its significance for understanding the
politics in India, raise ethical dilemmas involved in an ethnographic research of a right-wing movement, and conceptualize Hindutva as a schizophrenic nationalism. This will set the
scene for a more detailed discussion in the rest of the book. The

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

topic of Hindu nationalism has been approached by scholars,
intellectuals, politicians, activists, and ordinary people from
many different angles. I do not offer a comprehensive overview
of these approaches nor do I claim to provide an exhaustive
account of Hindutva. I focus on providing an in-depth analysis
of Hindu nationalist politics of fear and imagination.
What is Hindu Nationalism?
The discourse of Hindu nationalism—Hindutva—is best understood as a collection of eclectic ideas, images, and practices. It
is tempting to reject Hindutva as an intellectually bankrupt
idea, as a collective fantasy of a few delusional individuals, as an
illiberal attack on the secular multiethnic plurality of India, or
as a regressive extremist movement based on a problematic and
empirically flawed category of the “Hindu nation.” For instance,
such rejectionist approaches were evident after the national
elections of 2009 with many commentators discussing the
Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) defeat as a product of, as well as
contributing to, the existential crisis within Hindu nationalism.
If Hindutva is indeed in crisis, what explains its tenacity and
hold over a significant section of Hindus inside India and in
the diaspora? Could this be a case of political setback without
a serious dent in Hindutva’s cultural project and the long-term
vision for a Hindu India? That Hindu nationalism has so far
failed to provide a stable basis for an ever-expanding political
movement does not challenge its more pernicious project of
shaping a Hindu samaj (society) and sanskriti (culture) into
existence. Hindu nationalism remains a significant force in the
Indian political landscape.
Hindu nationalism is embodied within various political and
cultural organizations, most of which are branded as being
part of the Sangh Parivar (the Sangh family). While the BJP is
the main political party associated with the Sangh family, most
identify the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or the Sangh)
as the primary ideological source. Other members of the Sangh
family include the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal,

Rashtra Sevika Samiti, Durga Vahini, and so on (see Jaffrelot
2005; Kanungo 2006).
Political Hindutva has become especially significant since
the 1990s, the decade that saw the end of Indian National
Congress’s dominance and the rise of the BJP. But the history
of Hindu nationalism in India is as long as that of the mainstream nationalism represented mainly by the Congress (see
Jaffrelot 1999; Misra 2004; Zavos 2000). The attitude of many
leaders and activists from the supposedly secular Congress
toward majoritarian communalism (of which Hindu nationalism is the primary articulation) and communal violence has
been ambiguous. As Gould argues about the early twentieth
century, “Congress’s close association with forms of secularism that were based on the attractive and acceptable notion
of a ‘Hindu’ civilisation and culture broke down any possible
taboo surrounding religious mobilization in the locality”
(2004: 9).
Yet, BJP and its Hindutva ideology are different and distinct
from the dominant ideals of the Indian state as secular. Its
rhetoric of democracy, rights, and nation is based on a simplistic majoritarian principle and runs along the following lines:
since Hindus are the majority in India, it is “natural” and “democratic” that their “rights” should be promoted by the Indian
state, which hitherto has been “pseudo-secular,” indulging in
the appeasement of the minorities. The Hindutva movement
therefore is a “conservative revolution,” combining paternalist
and xenophobic discourses with democratic and universalist
ones on rights and entitlements (Hansen 1999, 4). Hindutva
targets at influencing and controlling the Indian state and suppressing and domesticating the Muslim and Christian minorities. However, the primary goal is to transform the Hindus
themselves, to “awaken the Hindu nation” (see Chitkara 2003;
Hingle 1999; Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 2003). There is a
schizophrenic shuttling between the idea of a preexisting monolithic Hindu nation and a lamentation that most members of
this supposed nation do not fit into Hindutva’s template of an
ideal citizen of the Hindu nation. A Hindutva Web site’s call

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

illustrates this well: “No Hindu politics is possible unless there
is Hindu-Awakening. And that Hindu-Awakening is not yet in
sight (‘Hindus!’ n.d.).” Hindutva is as much about representing
the Hindu nation as it is about fabricating one. This has been
the case throughout the twentieth century (see Noorani 2002).
What is different at the start of the twenty-first century is the
respectability and influence gained by exponents of Hindutva
through participation in the government at the federal level as
well as in various states (such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, and Karnataka) allowing them to gain access to the
resources of the state. For instance, leaders who were seen as
firebrand ideologues during the 1990s have become members
of the government, non-Hindutva politicians competed over
who is a more authentic Hindu, school children were taught a
history where militant Hinduism is normalized and minority
religions such as Islam (and as a corollary, Indian Muslims) are
alienated, and government employees joined Hindutva organizations. Thus, there has been a visible shift to the Right in Indian
politics and the ascendancy of Hindutva forces is its clearest
manifestation. However, it is worth noting that the ascendancy
of Hindutva is contested and uneven throughout the country,
affected by various local, political, and social factors.
Approaching Hindutva
Hindu nationalism is a majoritarian nationalism that equates
India with Hindu society and claims to be a genuine representative of the Hindu majority population in India. Muslims and
Christians, as religious minorities, are cast as “foreign” and those
whose loyalty to India is suspect. Couching itself in cultural
terms, Hindu nationalism is essentially a political movement
seeking to purify culture and transform society in India. The
capturing of the state is seen as a means to an end, to create a
Hindu nation. The Hindu nationalist movement has been extensively studied in the context of its organization, communalism,
and relation with the officially secular Indian state (see Basu
et al. 1993; Berglund 2004; Brass 2006, 2003, 1997; Brass and
Vanaik 2002; Das 1990; Datta 1993; Hansen 1999; Hansen and

1990; Sarkar 2002; Varshney 2002; Wilkinson 2005).
Communalism as an ideology operates at the level of the
individual as well as the collective—the identity and interests
of individuals are seen as coinciding with that of the collective,
the community. In this sense, it is deterministic. For instance,
in the case of Hindu-Muslim communalism, every individual is
reduced to only a Hindu or only a Muslim—no other identities
matter. The determinism of communal discourse dehumanizes
the Other and poses it as a danger to the security of the Self. Paul
Brass’s discussion of the Hindu communal discourse (1997,
2003, 2004, 2006) is instructive as a starting point. According
to him (in Shah 2004), there are four central elements of the
discourse that define Hindu-Muslim relations: historicization
(rendering history as one of antagonism, invasion, separatism); memorialization (calling attention to signs of “maleficent
Muslim presence” such as mosques, enclaves branded as “miniPakistans,” institutions such as the Aligarh Muslim University);
demonization (of the Muslims); and body symbolism (the
conflict between Hindus and Muslims as involving dismemberment and vivisection of the Hindu body by Muslims).
What the nationalist narratives (both secular and communal) in India often ignore is their subscription to the Orientalist
understandings of Hinduism. “Deriving largely from the orientalist construction of Hinduism, emergent national consciousness appropriated this definition of Hinduism as well as what is
regarded as the heritage of Hindu culture” (Thapar 1989, 229).
Nationalist histories (especially Hindu nationalist ones) borrow
heavily from Orientalist scholarship that saw Indian Muslims
primarily in terms of foreignness as well as stereotypes such as
monolithic, fanatic, et cetera (Metcalf 1995, 955–956). In the contemporary times, while Hindu nationalists rally against “foreign
influences” and make claims to authenticity, “through the colonially established apparatus of the political, economic, and educational institutions of India, contemporary Indian self-awareness
remains deeply influenced by Western presuppositions about the
nature of Indian culture” (King 1999, 117).

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Hindutva shares the neo-Orientalist belief in the primordial
naturalness of Hindu-Muslim violence in India (most Western
media tend to report it as “historic clash”). Like many other
scholars, I reject this belief and argue that “riots” (spectacular
incidents of intercommunal collective violence) are not a direct
product of communalism (where communities are bounded,
historical, and fixed). Instead, I adopt a social constructionist
position that sees “communal” riots as exercises in the construction of communities through definition (of what is the Self and
what is the Other), mobilization (of the “Self ”), and purification (erasure of commonalities). Communalism is not merely
a reflection of a preexisting community but the will to create a
bounded community (see Pandey 1990).
In this work, I have relied mostly upon two types of primary
sources, verbal and written. The first includes personal conversations and interviews with Hindutva leaders and activists and
observation of Hindu nationalist events and sites. This resulted
from ethnographic research conducted in Ayodhya, Hardwar,
Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, and Ahmedabad in the winter of
2004–2005. The second source is the writings of Hindutva intellectuals available in various forms including books, pamphlets,
tracts, posters, training manuals, online articles, Web sites,
discussion lists, and speeches. Some of these printed materials
were available through RSS shops in Delhi and Nagpur, others
were meant for circulation within the small circle of sympathizers and certainly not for public consumption. The online
articles are available to everyone, though some of the key Web
sites I used have gone off-line. The use of secondary sources,
including existing academic scholarship, is kept to a minimum
since the purpose here is to identify and analyze how (and
not why) a particular form of nationalism makes sense of the
world through a specific use of politics, representation, fear,
and imagination.
Ethics of Scholarship
I analyze Hindu nationalism as a collective political movement, usually a forte of social sciences, using an ethnographic

approach (see also Bacchetta 2004; Banerjee 2005; Brosius 2005;
Hansen 1999). Traditional social scientific frameworks tend to
ignore the self-understanding of the political actors themselves
and privilege their own explanatory authority. The focus is usually on the political, economic, and social factors behind the rise
of Hindu nationalism as a political movement and the ways in
which it transforms the wider state-society relations in India.
In this kind of analysis, the self-understanding of the Hindu
nationalists themselves is underemphasized; the poetics and
politics of their imaginations usually ignored. But the choice of
ethnography as a method is not without its own problems. In
my case, it forced me to confront my own politics of scholarship: how do I conduct fieldwork among actors who indulge in
politics I completely disagree with? Should I express my disgust
and lose the opportunity to gather ethnographic material? How
do we conduct ethnographic research with activists who are in
the regular business of dehumanizing a significant section of
humanity? When someone glorifies rape or murder, do we challenge him and thus give away the valuable opportunity to get
an insight into how they justify it to themselves? Do we laugh
at pejorative jokes about Muslim female anatomy and thus get
more research material, or do we express our disgust and terminate our research? The moral and ethical dilemmas posed by
the ethnographic part of my research remain unresolved.
My feminist scholarship implies that I must confront real
as well as epistemic violence played out in my name, even if it
means being a traitor to my identity categories—gender, caste,
religious, and nationalist. Betrayal is a virtue when one’s subjectivity is privileged. My “Hindu, Brahmin, male” identity allowed
the Hindutva leaders and activists, especially in small towns, to
see me as an insider and, therefore, a potential sympathizer. It led
to often intimate conversations with male Hindutva leaders and
activists, which provided valuable resource for this ethnography
of the imagination. On the other hand, similar identity categories were a hindrance when dealing with women activists. I often
went along with the activists’ reading of me during my ethnographic research in 2004–2005 as a natural sympathizer due to
my perceived social identity as a Brahmin, Hindu, middle-class

male, because it allowed me to gain insights into the imaginative
politics of Hindu nationalist male activists.
However, the tension between my role as a researcher interested
mostly in gathering research materials and as a human being who
sees majoritarian/masculinist nationalism as a grave danger to
societies shaped my pursuit. During ethnographic fieldwork,
I privileged the former through an adoption of curiosity and
silence while always aware that this divide between researcherhuman being is spurious and problematic. Conscience was a
casualty as I listened to activists often boasting about raping
Muslim women or joking about Muslim sexuality or moral
depravity. I was indeed interested in sexualized jokes and sextalks as ethnographic sites. My silence was read as complicity
by most of the Hindu activists with whom I interacted, even
though they knew I was a researcher. The academic writing that
followed my research also sought to impose its own discipline.
For instance, one reviewer advised me to use neutral language
and not be one-sided in my critique of Hindu nationalism for
an excessive politicization detracts from the objectivity of the
work. However, I confess here that I am not neutral and I remain
committed to providing a scholarly critique of Hindu nationalism that is in the final instance a political critique. Here, in the
tradition of feminist and postcolonial writings, I have pushed
the boundaries of academic writing to avoid a depoliticization
of my subject and subjectivity. I do not endeavor to provide an
authoritative overview of Hindu nationalism, nor a survey of
the rich body of scholarship that already exists. I am very much
present in my writing about a political movement that legitimizes itself in my name, in the name of my identities.
How does the author ensure that the reader can make a clear
distinction between her views and those of extremists she is
analyzing? The author could use scare quotes or emphasis or
he could use qualifying words to maintain a distance between
himself and those he is studying. To prevent a disruption of
the flow of argument, I keep the use of scare quotes, qualifying
words such as “supposedly,” “according to Hindu nationalists,”
“in the view of Hindutva,” and so on to a minimum. Writing
is a tricky exercise, especially so when one is describing an

extremist worldview. My own position is clear—a disagreement with everything Hindu nationalists say, and thus, when
readers come across a sentence or a phrase that may be read as
prejudicial, they should assume that I am describing the Hindu
nationalist viewpoint. For instance, if a sentence reads as
“Muslims and Christians are disloyal to India” or “Minorities
pose a serious threat to the Hindu nation” even without any
qualifier such as “according to Hindutva ideologues” or “in the
view of Hindu nationalist activists,” readers must understand
that the qualifier is implied. If I highlight the problematic
ways in which words, phrases, and terms are used by Hindutva
in each and every sentence, it will make the writing tedious
and filled with qualifiers. I also put the onus upon the readers to appreciate irony or sarcasm that may be implied in my
sentences, especially when I am giving a pen picture of Hindu
nationalist views.
A Schizophrenic Nationalism
Hindutva is a schizophrenic nationalism (for a discussion of
nationalism and schizophrenia in a different context, see Kane
2007). One that brings together politics of imagination, insecurity, cultural transformation, and social mobilization in a
manner that generates violence and fear while at the same time
allows for the myth of tolerant Hindus to go unchallenged.
I do not imply that individual Hindu nationalists suffer from
a pathological disorder or that no other nationalism is schizophrenic. I have no intention of dehumanizing individuals suffering from schizophrenia; I merely use a layperson’s idea of the
disorder to analyze a collective phenomenon.
In fact all nationalist movements are to a variable extent
based on contradictions, delusions, fantasies, and fragmentations. Hindutva is akin to majoritarian nationalisms (such as
Han chauvinism in China, Hutu supremacy in Rwanda, white
supremacism in the United States., neo-Nazism and antiSemitism in many central and eastern European countries,
radical Islamism in Egypt, or extremist Zionism in Israel)
that combine a cultural hubris with political anxiety about

the presence of minorities in the body politic. A better understanding of Hindu nationalism may come from a comparative
approach but in this book the focus is exclusively on Hindutva’s
schizophrenic Self.
If Hindu nationalism had been an individual, it would have
been classified as exhibiting an abnormality, one that may be
amenable to treatment. But it is not an individual; it is an idea
for a collective movement. Curing Hindutva of its paranoia,
hallucinations, and delusions will dissolve the rationale for its
existence. To put it simply, Hindutva’s schizophrenia is productive of its identity; without it, Hindu nationalism is a dead
proposition.
There are many consistent identifiable patterns in the discourse of Hindu nationalism. Yet beneath the illusion of consistency there is a selective amnesia of several contradictions
that populate the Hindutva worldview. Here I highlight a few
of these contradictions and fantasies that provide meaning to
the majoritarian nationalism of Hindutva. I will expand them
in the subsequent chapters. The contradictions are as much
a source of weakness as of strength. They militate against a
coherent large-scale political movement. But, they also enable
a flexibility, fungibility, and ambiguity for extremist, parochial,
and illiberal ethos of Hindutva to pass itself off as moderate,
universalist, and enlightened. The primary contradiction is to
do with a “Hindu nation.”
What makes Hindutva different from any other nationalism in India? It is the accent on Hindu. Unlike the mainstream
Gandhi-Nehru-Congress civic nationalism, which asserted its
legitimacy in the name of all the residents of India irrespective
of their religious affiliation, Hindutva’s legitimacy is its ethnoreligious claim (see Jaffrelot 1999) to speak for the majority
Hindu religious community. Their raison d’être for the idea of
Hindutva is the privileging of the putative Hindu community
in the territory of India.
The way Hindu gets defined is unclear. RSS and other Hindu
nationalist leaders claim to present an open-minded flexible
notion of Hindu and Hindutva, which is about culture and way
of life rather than about a specific religion. For instance, the

RSS leader K. S. Sudarshan says, “Anyone who is the national of
this country, irrespective of being a Shaiva, Shakta, Vaishnava,
Sikh, Jain, Muslim, Christian, Paris, Buddhist or Jew by way of
his creed or mode of worship, is a Hindu” (in Seshadri et al.
1990). Hindutva is assumed to imply an undefinable notion
of Indianization and is thus non-confessional. RSS and other
Hindu nationalists often make use of a few Supreme Court
judgments to bolster their stance that Hindutva is not equal to
religious fundamentalism. The Supreme Court pronounced in
1990s to the effect that Hindutva or Hinduism “per se and in
an abstract sense—which are related more to the way of life of
people in the sub-continent than to the narrow limits of the
religion—cannot be assumed to mean and be equated with
narrow fundamentalist religious bigotry” (in “Hindutva Not
a Narrow concept” 1995; for a critical discussion see Nauriya
1996; Sen 2007). However, I would like to point out that when
Hindu nationalists adopt the statements of the Supreme Court
judges to validate their position, they do so very selectively. The
(in)famous 1995 judgment given by Justice Verma had said that
“unless the context of a speech indicates a contrary meaning or
use, in the abstract these terms [Hindu/Hindutva] are indicative
more of a way of life of the Indian people and are not confined
merely to describe the persons practicing the Hindu religion
as a faith” and that “the kind of the use made of the word
‘Hindutva,’ the context and the composition of the audience to
which the speech is addressed are all significant” (in “Hindutva
Not a Narrow Concept” 1995). The Hindu nationalists interpret
it as a victory of their notion of Hindutva as non-communal
and almost always ignore the parts of the judgment that dealt
with the specificity of context and use of “Hindutva.”
For instance, in an RSS tract Clean Answers to Confused
Questions, the SC judgment is adapted to make a claim that
“Hindutva has been looked upon as nationalism. It should be
considered a contempt for the decision of the Supreme Court to
accuse Hindutva of communalism or of hostility towards other
religions” (RSS n.d.: 1). Further in the same tract that claims
that Hindutva is committed to the ideology of Hinduism “Let
all people be happy” (RSS n.d.: 6), religious conversions are

rejected because a “person born in India forgets his ancestors
and becomes a part of aggressors after his conversion” (7), and
“the frequent partitions of India prove that the regions where
Hindus are reduced to minority start agitating for separation.
A united Hindu society is the only way to an integrated India”
(8). If Hindu nationalists are sincere about Hindu or Hindutva
being a cultural nationalism for all Indians and not a preserve
of any religion, surely what specific religion people belong to
should not be a matter of concern. But it is—there is a visible tension between a generous notion of Hindu (as a way
of life in India that is pluralistic, culturally nationalistic, and
not confined to the Hindu religion) and the more common
narrow notion of Hindu (non-Muslim, non-Christian, Hindu
religionists).
The sincerity of those Hindu nationalists who claim the
“Hindu” category to be an inclusive and nonreligious one (for
instance, the RSS insisting that Hindu for them is anyone who
regards Bharat/India as his/her motherland, fatherland, and
sacred land) is questionable because the terms of membership into the Hindu/Indian club make sense only within a
confessional framework. If “Hindu” is indeed a geographically
located national identity and could include Indian Muslims
and Christians, why only idolize certain historical figures who
had fought Muslim rulers or adopt Bhagwa Dhwaj (saffron
flag), which is unmitigatedly confessional, or see only temples
as “symbols of national pride” (Bajpai and Barthawal 2001: 26)?
While celebrating the ability of the “Hindu” to subsume all
(“Hinduism in teachings and practice has always followed pluralism—Oberoi 2001: 12—and, therefore, is open to all faiths),
it is clear that the terms on which other religionists will be
accepted will be set solely by Hindutva. The RSS’s previous chief
K. S. Sudarshan said that Muslims were free to join the RSS but
only if they call themselves “Hindu” since Hindu relates to citizenship (“Muslims welcome” 2006).
Hindu nationalists imagine the Hindu community as consisting of all castes, subcastes, outcastes along with Sikhs,
Buddhists, and Jains, all religionists they call “indigenous” except
the “foreign religionists” adhering to Islam and Christianity

(as exemplified in Joshi et al. 2003)—in short everyone except
Muslims and Christians. However, in practice, their relationship
to Sikhism or Buddhism is also problematic. In contemporary
times, Hindutva argues that Hindus are a distinct politicocultural nation, a nation whose numerical majority has not
translated into a political majority in post-independence India.
This “discrimination” is ascribed to a conspiratorial alliance
of Islam, Church, Communists, Secularists, and Westernized
media; this is detailed in chapters 2 and 3. Hindutva wants the
Hindu nation to acquire its rightful place within India. But
where is this Hindu nation?
While Hindu nationalism claims to represent the Hindu
nation, Hindu nationalists also lament the absence of a united
Hindu collective. Hindu nationalist political consciousness has
never been hegemonic among Hindus in India. A close analysis of the writings of Hindutva leaders and ideologues shows
that while Sanatana Dharma is used as the umbrella term and
(mis)quotes from non-Hindutva leaders including Bhimrao
Ambedkar, Sri Aurobindo, or Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
are selectively scavenged upon to make a case against Muslims
and Christians, Hindu nationalism’s main grudge is against
Hindus themselves for not being united. Hindutva suffers from
melancholia and hence has a low self-esteem (Miller 1996).
The exhortation of Hindutva ideologues is for the Hindus to
“awaken,” “arise,” recognize the enemies, vote for pro-Hindu
parties to punish anti-Hindu secularists and those who betray
their earlier promises of being pro-Hindutva, organize as a votebank, and remind the ungrateful Muslim and Christian minorities who the “real” (awakened Hindu nationalist) Hindus are.
The Hindu nation does not exist as a conscious corporate body,
and a Hindu nationalist seeks to create one. In this sense, while
claiming to be a mere representation of the preexisting nation,
Hindutva’s main emphasis is on creating this imaginary nation.
This process of representation-creation is intimately connected
with the question of Self-Other, something that will be discussed
in detail in later chapters.
Hindu nationalism is a celebration and affirmation of the
Hindu Self, but it derives its meaning only from a negation

of the minority Others and their allies (the communists,
secularists, and Westernized elite). The Hindu Self is represented as a self-evident category of identity that has existed for
millennia. The naturalization of this modern Hindu Self underemphasizes the historical and political processes through which
it has been created since the late nineteenth century starting
with the Revivalist movements and the beginning of religious
categories–based enumeration through Census (see Datta 1993;
Dayal 2004; DeVotta 2002; Jones 1981; Rajalakshmi 2004; Rao
2010). Going against the mainstream Indian nationalist movement, Hindu nationalism in the twentieth century sought to
present the Hindu Self as the Indian Self, rendering non-Hindu
Indians as untrustworthy Other, anti-Hindu, and invariably
anti-Indian.
It should be noted that Hindutva seeks to create a unified
Hindu samaj not by removing hierarchies nor by redressing
the historical and contemporary injustices suffered by many
Hindus but by shifting the blame for all ills onto the “foreign”
Other. Everything that is wrong within Hinduism is a product of a society perverted through a series of foreign invasions mostly by Muslim rulers. Dalits and indigenous people
(Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as identified in the
Indian Constitution) are appropriated within the Hindu fold
through the mode of assimilation without addressing the actually existing injustices or demands (on Hindutva’s caste politics, see Ganguly 2005; Jaffrelot 1998; Maclean 1999; Omvedt
2006; Narayan 2009). Reform of Hinduism is touted only as
a tool to counter the possible appeal of Islam or Christianity
for the hitherto unprivileged and oppressed Hindus. There is
no evidence of a genuine desire to make Hindu religion and
practices progressive. By creating the specter of the dangerous
Other, inimical foreigners within the rightful homeland of the
indigenous Hindu body politic, Hindutva seeks to brush under
the carpet, though not very successfully, the tensions existing
within the category “Hindu.”
The story of the Hindu Self is thus a story of non-Hindu/antiHindu Other (on the history of this, see Sharma 2003). Despite
the halfhearted claims made by some Hindu nationalists in the

BJP that Hindutva is not anti-Muslim or anti-Christian but is
universalist so long as Muslims and Christians accept to live on
the terms set by Hindutva, even a cursory examination of the
philosophy and ideology of all strands of Hindu nationalism
shows that representation of religious minorities (Muslims and
Christians) as inimical, foreign, anti-Hindu and, therefore, antiIndia is an obsession for many. The Hindu samaj, sanskriti, and
sabhyata (society, culture, and civilization) are under siege from
Islam and Christianity—this is not a nightmare but a waking
reality according to Hindutva. Deploying various stereotypes, it
represents the minorities, especially Muslims, as waging a war
against Hindu India. The extremely diverse Indian Muslims are
reduced to a singular stereotyped identity—“the Muslim”—and
invested with a belligerence and fanaticism that individual
Muslims cannot escape.
Hindu nationalists may differ among themselves over the
root of this supposed Muslim fanaticism—moderates in the
BJP or RSS may blame some Muslims for disloyalty and terrorism without mentioning Islam or Prophet Muhammad. But
many Hindu nationalists from the Sangh Parivar, especially
the VHP, Bajrang Dal, and even the RSS (RSS in practice if
not always in words), do not shy away from rejecting Islam in
its entirety as the enemy. Treating all Muslims with the same
Islamophobic brush, Hindutva plays a game of fear with many
strands—Islam by its very nature is fundamentalist (the idea of
moderate Muslims is an oxymoron); the history of Muslim rule
in India is nothing but a catalogue of crimes of violence, plunder, and rape of Hindus; Muslims are solely responsible for the
partition of Akhanda Bharat (united India) and those Muslims
who stayed back in India did so because they were not satisfied
with a separate Pakistan but desired the Islamization of the
whole of India; Muslims, with the active backing of Pakistani
and Gulf money, are waging a continuous war against Hindu
India. Terrorism, violence, genocide of Kashmiri Hindus, conversion, illegal infiltration by Bangladeshi Muslims, seduction
and rape of innocent Hindu girls, and overpopulation are
all conjured up as weapons used by the traitorous Muslims
to overwhelm Hindus in India. Christians are said to collude

in this war by seducing poor Hindus into conversion and by
encouraging separatism in the north eastern regions. By stereotyping Muslim and Christian minorities as the irredeemable
anti-Hindu, anti-India Other, Hindu nationalism generates a
politics of fear.
This process of essentializing and stereotyping antagonistic
identities (Self versus Other) is central to the Hindu nationalist project; a benign and pluralist imagination of minorities
on equal terms will take the wind out of the sails of Hindutva.
Poetics and politics of fear are instrumental in explaining away
the use of violence by Hindu nationalism as an avoidable reaction. Violence is central to an understanding of Hindutva. It
plays a dual role as it is the rationale for, as well as the product
of, Hindu nationalism. Hindu nationalists frequently indulge
in violence and yet it is the Muslims who are blamed for all
violence. All acts of anti-minority violence are sought to be
legitimized by ascribing them to just reactions and hurt sentiments of the long suppressed, unusually patient Hindu society.
In this way, the sufferings of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 and
Christians in Orissa in 2008 are seen not as the results of a conscious pogrom or a well-planned hate attack; rather, they are
claimed to be the regrettable but justifiable and understandable
reactions of the awakened Hindu community.
The state is absolved of all responsibility: after all, what
can it do when it is the entire Hindu society that lashes out in
hurt caused by an arrogant expansionary minority? Thus, in
the Hindu nationalist view, complicity of politicians, police,
activists, and the general populace are all bracketed under the
rubric of an aroused Hindu nation. This performs an important function of explaining away individual responsibilities
and state complicity. If it is the abstract Hindu nation that
has reacted to the originary violence of expansionary minorities, how does one begin pinpointing responsibility for the
violence? Numerous, well-documented, acts of anti-minority
violence committed in the name of Hindutva do not disrupt
the self-understanding of Hindu nationalists where they see
themselves as the wronged party.

As we will see in this book, contradictions, splits, fantasies,
and paranoia continue to be mobilized by Hindu nationalist
activists. The schizophrenic Hindutva Self remains a lethal
threat to the ideas of democracy, secularism, liberalism, and
plurality in India. A Hindu Rashtra, with domesticated unified
Hindus and subservient minorities, remains a vision for which
millions of Hindu nationalists continue to work.

Hindu Nation under Siege

H

indutva as a majoritarian nationalism presents itself as
an awakening of the majority Hindu community to the
threats it faces. It seeks to convert the numerical majority of
Hindus into a political dominance. Why should Hindus mobilize themselves politically as Hindus? Because if they don’t,
according to Hindu nationalist thinking, Hindus will soon be
reduced to a minority status in their own land, their country
will be lost, their culture and religion destroyed, their entire
civilization decimated.
According to Hindu nationalists, the threats to Hindu society
have not altered radically over time, especially since the beginning of the twentieth century. Islam and Christianity were
always the primary enemies, though over time communism,
secularism, and occasionally materialism have been added to
the list. What is remarkable is a consistency of pattern and a
sharing of vocabulary when it comes to assessing the threats
to the Hindu body politic. A microscopic approach that, in
the name of anthropological detail and capturing the nuances,
eschews an overview of the Hindutva thought-world, will fail to
notice these consistencies. One needs to have an overview and
make generalizations, and this is what this chapter does.
Writings and speeches of ideologues are repetitive, the characterization of enemies is formulaic, and even the personal narratives of activists located in geographically distant places have
similar motifs. New events and developments are added on as
empirical fodder to the ongoing saga of war that Hindus have

been facing—they merely reconfirm what Hindu nationalists
have been screaming from the very beginning. Nothing that
Muslims and Christians can do will challenge the Hindutva
framework of hostility. Transcending the boundaries of space and
time, appropriating incidents that may have occurred in different
parts of the world or in different historical periods, Hindutva sees
the Hindu nation as under attack from hostile forces. To quote a
booklet available from the RSS bookshop in Delhi:
Hindus at present are passing through a serious crisis. They are
facing the religious, social and political problems and challenges
both internally and externally of unprecedented magnitude
even in Hindu majority (85%) independent India. On the other
hand, the minorities, both Muslims and Christians, are enjoying all possible economic and political patronage and religious
advantages much more than the Hindus.
(Paliwal 2003: 3)

Across the different shades of extremism or moderation, Hindu
nationalists see the Hindu nation as equivalent to India. There
is no aspect of Indian nationalism that can be credited to nonHindus. Non-Hindus can occupy the position of a marginal
guest of the Indian/Hindu nation forever grateful to the Hindus
for their magnanimous hospitality or be the disloyal subjects of
the Indian state doomed to be outside the Indian nationhood.
At best, individual non-Hindus could, in theory, go against
their own religionists and prove their loyalty to India. But
most of the time, they will remain peripheral or a hurdle to the
national project.
Combing through leaflets, speeches, books, and online
sources produced by different Hindutva personalities and organizations, let me give a general picture of the Hindu nation
under siege from internal and external hostile forces. The
disproportionate focus here is on Islam and Muslims because
they are represented as the enemy number one. As a saying
among Hindutva sympathizers goes, “pehle kasai, phir isai”
(first the butcher—pejorative term for Muslims—and then the
Christians). On rare occasions, Christianity is seen as equal or a
greater threat. For instance, an ideologue writer Paliwal reminds

his readers that in independent India, “the tactics, strategies
and modes of operation of the christian missionaries have been
more subtle, cunning, fraudulent, and indirectly of far reaching
consequences than that of the Muslims” (2003: 31).
There are two ways in which one could approach the representations of threats to India/the Hindu nation—identifying the hostile forces posing the threat (Muslims, the Church, communists,
secularism, Westernized media) or outlining the different threats
posed by these hostile forces (terrorism, conversion, demographic
challenge, antinationalism, secessionism, denigration of Hindu
symbols, and so on). I combine the two and analyze the primary
ways in which representations render certain people, communities, ideas, and actors as hostile to the Hindu nation. Here the
focus will be on Islam and Christianity, and the next chapter
will examine in greater detail the sexual politics of representing
Muslims as enemy. Chapter 4 will briefly outline the different
ways in which Hindutva portrays the Hindu society as suffering
not only from outside attacks but also made weak due to internal
weaknesses and thus necessitating a reawakening.
A Calculated Conspiracy
Hindu nationalist narrative always starts with a positive view
of the Hindus before they were depraved by outside influences
and then goes on to catalogue historical and contemporary
legacies of the corrupt forces. This is typified in Goel’s booklet
Hindu Society Under Siege (n.d.; originally published in 1981).
Soon after the opening sentence, “Hindu society is the only significant society in the world today which presents a continuity
of cultural existence and functioning since time immemorial,”
Goel launches into why even after India’s independence in 1947,
Hindus remain unfavored in their own country:
The Muslim and British invasions of India, though defeated
and dispersed, have yet managed to crystallize certain residues—
psychological and intellectual—which a battered Hindu society
is finding it very difficult to digest. These residues are now in
active alliance with powerful international forces, and are being

aided and abetted on a scale which an impoverished Hindu
society cannot match. And, lastly, although at loggerheads
amongst themselves, these residues have forged a united front,
which is holding Hindu society under siege. The danger is as
much from within as from without.
(Goel n. d.b, emphases original)

Thus, the threats posed by Islam and Christianity are not mere
accidental products of incompatibility of religions, according to
the Hindu nationalists. The irrationality of these foreign religions
and their Indian followers is part of a well-planned conspiracy
to overwhelm Hindus. According to Goel (n.d.b), Islamism has
“evolved a strategy in which the Muslims of India are envisaged
as a base and an arsenal” and these strategies include brainwashing all Muslims and denouncing those individual Muslims
who may criticize Islam or stand for “the mainstream of India
nationalism”; contriving to “pass off as a downtrodden minority,
oppressed, exploited and treated as second class citizens by the
‘brute’ Hindu majority”; ganging up as a vote bank; agitating
for India’s support to all international Islamic causes; staging
“street riots on the slightest pretext”; using the frequent riots
to further frighten Muslims and coax them to live in exclusive
conclaves, which can then be used to stock arms and ammunition. A corollary to this seven-fold strategy is the conscious
efforts of Islamism to “frustrate the emergence of a genuine
and positive Indian nationalism by always harping on India’s
multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-language, multi-national and
multi-cultural character” (Goel n.d.b). Thus, Hindutva goes
against the dominant framing of Indian nationalism as “unity in
diversity.” While paying lip service to tolerance, Hindutva actors
often articulate their frustrations with plurality in India. In private, a number of activists express their preference for the RSS’s
monochromatic saffron flag (representing Hindu religion) over
the Indian national tricolor.
Bhasin’s tract (n.d), which has been banned by the provincial government of Maharashtra after complaints from Muslim
community groups, claims that the
Muslims within India after 1947 have recommended a plan of
action for all Muslims in India to use the following 10 methods

for immediate implementation: 1. Convert Hindus by every
means to embrace Islam. 2. By polygamy. God himself divinely
allows you this. 3. By thwarting any family planning programme.
4. Infiltrate into India from all directions to grow fast as servants
of Allaha. 5. Form Muslim majority geo-political areas within
India. 6. Force Mass expulsion of Hindus when they come close to
being a religious minority. 7. Jehad is the duty of every Muslim. Be
Allaha’s own soldiers to fight & kill those who oppose his diction
as said in Qur’an. 8. Let no nonbeliever dare settle where you have
come into close majority. 9. Abduct women of Hindus to breed
out of them your children. Hindu abducted woman are delivered
to you as MALE GANIMAT [booty]. 10. Attack the foundation
of Hindu culture in India, their temples and their books. They
will then automatically follow Allaha’s ordainment and convert to
ISLAM. Know thus, that India is under attack of ISLAM.

This tract leaves no room for doubt about categories of identity or the intention of the actors. “Muslims within India after
1947 have recommended a plan of action”—how did millions
of Muslims, divided along caste, regional, class, ideological, and
linguistic lines living throughout the length and breadth of the
vast country come up with “a plan of action” was not a question
worth pondering for Bhasin (n.d.). For Bhasin, as for all Hindu
nationalists, all Muslims act as a herd, as a single corporate
body. Diversity of Muslim lives is papered over as an artificial
homogenized identity of Indian Muslims is created.
For Hindutva, the lethality of siege comes from the conspiratorial combination of forces of Islam and Church, support provided to them by communists and secularists, and finally lack
of resistance from the ignorant, misguided, Westernized/decultured, disunited Hindus. The “United Front of Hostile Forces,”
according to Goel, work together in India because:
They have chosen to feed upon different limbs of the large-sized
Hindu society. Christianism is busy amongst Hindu “tribals”
whom Hindu society had always left undisturbed. Islamism
is on the prowl amongst the Harijans whom a power-hungry
leadership is fast preparing for political blackmail. Communism
is spreading its tentacles amongst the upper and middle classes
whom it parades as its “proletarian base.”

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

The tensions between Christians and Muslims in many parts
of the world are not lost to the ideologues; but the emphasis is
laid on the Church and Islam suspending their competition in
India. According to Paliwal, both are working hand in hand to
annihilate the Hindus and Hindu Dharma first, and probably,
later on, they will settle scores between themselves (2003: 16).
Hindutva writers do not care to explain how the disparate
forces come together or through what institutions or personalities they coordinate to put their supposed plan into action.
Finding Allies
Sometimes Hindutva portrays the problems faced by Hindus as
a local manifestation of a global crisis. This is done mostly in
the case of globalized Islamic fundamentalism. A contextualized understanding of Political Islam or Islamic fundamentalism in different parts of the world is eschewed in favor of a
simplistic picture—Global Jihad against non-Muslims. Samuel
Huntington’s “Clash of Civilization” thesis (Huntington 1993)
was referred to innumerable times by my Hindutva respondents as confirming what they already knew. That Muslims
are responsible for violence in different parts of the world is
almost common sense for the subscribers of Hindu nationalism. For instance, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the head of the
Ram temple movement in Ayodhya, in a personal conversation
said, “Muslims are anti-nationalists in India, in the UK, in the
Netherlands, everywhere” (Personal Interview 2005e). Dr Ram
Vilas Vedanti, an outspoken senior sadhu and two-time member
of Indian Parliament with the BJP (1996–1998 and 1998–1999),
made a clear statement to me, “The United States has launched
a war on Muslims. We will join them” (Vedanti 2005).
The image, therefore, is of Muslims as the problem par
excellence in the world and Hindus as one of the many victims.
Hindu nationalist activists in the United States, for instance,
often sympathize with Israel and the West for being victims
of a common enemy. But this desire to work with rightwing Jewish Zionists, Christian Zionists, and Islamophobic
commentators is a phenomenon confined mostly to the

United States. Notwithstanding recent overtures made by the
RSS and its publications to praise India-Israel cooperation,
Hindu nationalists in India, especially those who are active in
transforming the society and often not directly involved with
BJP politics, have no such strong well-thought plan to create
a wide coalition against Muslims because Jews are not part of
the picture.
Hindu Exceptionalism
A narcissistic nationalist will by definition be preoccupied with
an inflated sense of the Self. For Hindu nationalism, the dangers
faced by the Hindu Self—Self can be the individual as well as
the community—is uniquely multifaceted and vicious. Many
Hindu nationalists lament the exceptional danger faced by India.
Some point out that China and India are the only historical civilizations that have so far survived the onslaught of Semitic religions; others argue that India is uniquely under pressure either
because the Chinese have adopted an egalitarian principle of
keeping all religions suppressed (Personal Interview 2005e) or
because they are communist (the implication is that this has
compromised China’s link with its own past), or because China
is opening up to the Church. There was a general lack of knowledge about China among the Hindutva activists I conversed
with. In Ashok Singhal’s view as exemplified in a pamphlet
distributed at a gathering of sadhus in Hardwar in 2005, China
has opened itself to Christian missionaries after its alliance with
the United States, and now “India is the only country in the
world that is still combating the armies of Church and Islam”
(n.d.). The world geography of most Hindu nationalist activists
within India is thus quite narrow and distorted—the focus is on
three major entities of Hindu India, Islamic world, and the West
(Christian world). For instance, during a conversation with a
few Bajrang Dal activists outside a gathering of VHP leaders
in Hardwar in 2005, a middle-aged man, who refused to give
his name, explained to a captive audience that “three types of
people shape international politics—Christians who have guns
but prefer to spread by preaching, Muslims who are happy to

use violence to expand, and the Hindus who are peaceful and
thus remain powerless despite their cultural superiority.” Such
a simplistic and reductionist view of international politics does
not imply ignorance or stupidity of Hindu nationalist individuals but their priority. Preoccupied with giving their Hindutva
gloss to life at the local and the national level, international
events are brought into the picture only to confirm their preexisting view. Evidence that complicate the culturalist viewpoint
of Hindutva or that show Muslims or Christians as not predatory are always ignored.
China is occasionally added to the list of major players
(Hindu, Islam, and Christian West) by some Hindu nationalists,
but there is only a scant reference to a Buddhist world in East
Asia and no place for Africa or Native America ravaged by the
Western colonial Christianity. There is no sustained attempt to
understand civilizations and cultures other than that of Hindu
India. According to Champat Rai, a man who had been actively
involved in the destruction of Babri mosque in Ayodhya in
1992 and has become the Organizing Secretary of VHP recently,
“We have nothing to learn from others since their values have
not stood the test of time for more than a few hundred years”
(Personal Interview 2005f). Such narcissistic view of the Hindu
Self feeds into the discourse of vulnerability and asserts the
need to defend this precious Self from the enemies.
Defining the Boundary
Nationalism and boundary making is intimately linked. Who
belongs to the national community, who does not belong to
it, where to draw the boundary of the nation—these questions
are often more vexed than the drawing up of boundaries of
states. While states’ borders have legal and territorial identity
(this is not to deny the constructed and contested nature of
the borders), a nation’s identity is more complicated to define.
The people inhabiting a nation can be subject to ambiguous,
messy, shifting, and contested notions of nationalism. Different
nationalist movements will have their own ideas of who is part
of the national Self and who will remain outside it.

In the case of Hindu nationalism, it is interesting to note
the discursive placing of Muslims and Christians both inside as
well as outside. In much of the writings, Islam and Christianity
are rejected as imperialistic and foreign while Indian Muslims
and Christians (the majority of whom have converted from
some form of Hindu religion at some point in history) are seen
as enemies within the country. Occasionally, some Hindutva
ideologues will use this distinction between the alien religions
and indigenous converts to emphasize that they are not antiMuslim but merely anti-Islam; that their politics are informed
by disagreement with an ideology rather than with people.
For instance, according to a pamphlet, “Indian Muslims are
descendants of . . . victims of Islamic imperialism. They are
culturally and anthropologically very much Indian. Due to the
imposed alien Arab ideology of Islam, their loyalties lie with
the pan-Islamic issues, as they do not know the cruel history
of the forced conversion of their ancestors”(Krishnaswami
n.d.: 18). Such a statement can deceive one into believing that
Hindutva may offer a space to Indian Muslims or Christians
within a Hinduized body politic so long as they give up their
foreign ideology. It is not surprising then that Hindu nationalist leaders parrot the line of “we are not anti-minority, we are
pro-Hindu and anti-minoritism.” The claim of Hindu nationalism to be inclusive is spurious, for how can Indian Muslims or
Christians give up their “foreign,” “imperialistic” religion, short
of apostasy? They are not exhorted to experiment with more
indigenous forms of Islam or Christianity nor to moderate
their religious practices. The entire gamut of religious beliefs is
rejected in toto as foreign.
Too much significance should not be given to the claims of
Hindutva ideologues to distinguish between bad religion and
not-bad followers of the religion. The image of Indian converts
as victims of fear, greed, and duplicity is not only patronizing
and ahistorical, it also shifts the attention away from the politics of making this distinction. It allows Hindu nationalists to
express hatred of certain religions on ideological grounds while
at the same time excusing themselves of accusations of hatred
against minorities in India. In fact, a close study of how Hindu

nationalist ideas are put into practice, or what the ideologues
making this distinction go on to say elsewhere in their writings, or how activists see their enemies, shows that Hindutva is
fuelled by a suspicion and hatred of Islam as well as Muslims,
of Christianity as well as Christians.
Adopting a systematic scientific garb, Joshi et al. (2003)
provide a study of religious demography of India and focus
on heterogeneity introduced by “foreign religionists” (Muslims
and Christians), and not foreign religions, in India. This study
becomes important because it gets quoted and cross-referred
to by several pamphlets and online discussions as a “scientific
proof ” of the decline of Hindus in India and the Foreword was
written by Lal Krishna Advani, the Home Minister of India at
the time of book’s release. In his foreword Advani does not use
the words Islam, Muslim, Christianity, or Christians but leaves
no doubt what his implication is:
For more than a millennium now, India has been host to some
of the greatest, most vigourous and expansive religions of
the world. This circumstance has endowed India with a rich
diversity; but it has also given rise to some of the most acute
strategic, political and administrative problems that the Indian
nation has had to face in the past and continues to face till today.
Rigourous and continuous observation and analysis of the
changing demography of different religious groups in various
regions of the country is therefore of paramount importance
in maintaining the integrity of our borders and peace, harmony
and public order within the country.
(in Joshi et al. 2003: 4)

This quote illustrates the facile nature of distinction drawn
between the “foreign religions” and “foreign religionists.” Both
are seen as expansionary and security threats to the Hindu
nation.
Accent on the Enemy Within
Hostile ideologies confront Hindu nation and Hindu society mainly through their followers—the so-called “foreign

religionists,” the Muslims and Christians, as well as “foreign”
ideas of communism, secularism, and Westernization. Ashok
Singhal in his speech to the VHP’s Dharma Sansad (“Religious
Parliament,” an event VHP periodically organizes to bring
together religious as well as Hindutva figures) in December
2005 put the spotlight on the unholy alliance of internal and
external enemies of India and Hindu nation—Muslims are
backed by the rich Gulf states; Christians get support from
Europe and the United States; communists, who are Hindus but
have rejected Hindu dharma, are financed by China; secularist,
opportunist Hindus who align with caste-based parties and
destroy Hindu culture for selfish reasons, are backed by all the
anti-India and anti-Hindu forces (Singhal 2005).
That nationalisms operate through a conception of the Self
and the Other is well accepted. For Hindutva, the most dangerous Others are within the Indian society, living among the
Hindu population, and thereby weakening the Hindu national
body. They live within but remain without loyalty to it. The dual
positionality of Muslim and Christian minorities in Hindutva
worldview makes them the most lethal enemies, more so than
even the foreign actors (the Western or Islamic world) they are
accused of working for.
Nationalist movements, especially in their formation stages,
invest plenty of energy in defining the Self by distinguishing
it from the foreign Other. Anticolonial nationalisms reject
the colonizers as foreign and hence illegitimate rulers. For
example, for the mainstream Indian National Congress’s version of Indian nationalism, British rulers (not their ideas,
religion, or the British people per se) were the alien Other. It
is worth noting that for Hindutva the main enemy has never
been the British, but the Muslims and sometimes the Church.
The moment of departure for Hindu nationalism is not the
consolidation of European rule in India in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, but the invasions by Muslim rulers starting with Mahmud of Ghazni in the early eleventh century.
British imperial rule is rendered as just another episode in
the long campaign of onslaught waged by foreign religionists
on the Hindu society. Reference to the British as inimical is

conspicuous by its absence within all the writings, speeches,
and conversations I have analyzed. The main fault of the British
was that they introduced Christian missionaries, though some
writers go on to praise the British officials for not giving a free
hand to the missionaries. For instance, Goel while putting forward his thesis of Hindus under siege, for the first time in 1981,
points out that Christian crusaders never acquired the foothold that Islam did in India because the British rulers did not
allow them to “use state power, directly and in an uninhibited
manner” maybe because they had undergone a “Renaissance”
(I assume he means Reformation) and a decline of religion in
Europe (Goel n.d.b.). This reservation of primary antipathy for
distant historical Muslim rule (pre-eighteenth century) vis-á-vis
the more recent British rule should not surprise a historian
of Hindu nationalism. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, too, Hindu nationalists focused on combating
Muslims more than challenging the British. Contemporary
Hindu nationalists often moan that the partition of India was a
tragic vivisection of “Mother India,” a cutting of her limbs and
some even hope for Akhanda Bharat (undivided India that will
include present-day Pakistan as well as Bangladesh; for a discussion on Akhanda Hindustan during the British colonial rule,
see Bhagavan 2008). But when one scratches under the surface,
it is clear that the fantasy is not so much a recovery of undivided Hindu India as it is of purifying the present day India of
its “foreign religionists.” The fantasy is not of expansion but of
expulsion. Paliwal expresses this when he writes that Hindus
and Muslims are two different nations and “the non-exchange
of Hindu-Muslim population [India insisted on being home to
all religious groups] was a more serious blunder even than the
partition of India itself ” (2003: 19).
Though Pakistan is often brought into the discussion as an
enemy, the focus remains on Indian Muslims. In fact, the construction of Pakistan (and not Islam) as the archenemy of India is
seen by Hindutva as a ploy of secularists to distract people’s attention. According to Krishnaswami (n.d.: 30), it is a “mean trick” of
the pseudo-secularists to “blame Pakistan but insulate and absolve
the Islam from any charges of terrorist crimes . . . ‘Pakistan is bad

but Islam is good’ is a media sponsored fraud.” This move to shift
the battle from a specific neighboring state to a global religion of
Islam does not indicate an appetite to fight Muslims everywhere
but a desire to contain Muslims living within India. During the
VHP’s Dharma Sansad of December 2005, I heard many sadhus,
saints, and ideologues sloganeering as if they aimed to conquer
Islam everywhere (one story I was told was that beneath the
Kaaba in Mecca is a Shiva linga and once a Hindu pours water
from the Holy river Ganges there, the Kaaba will be destroyed and
Muslims defeated). However, when it came to serious discussions
on how to further their goals, the focus was always on the immediate enemy—the Indian Muslims and Christians.
Historicization of the Present: Cataloguing Crime
In the Hindutva worldview, the challenge from Islam is not
new, but part of a centuries-long struggle. Hindu-Muslim
relations are read in terms of historical continuity where present-day Muslim minorities carry on waging the war that their
predecessors had started. The idea of nation is taken as perennial and primordial. Though Christianity’s history in India is
more recent in comparison to Islam’s, the former’s theology,
too, is represented as violent. In the words of Paliwal, “History
of Christianity and Islam is full of bloodshed, barbarism, massacre and genocide of innocent people of other faiths . . . mainly
due to the concept of prophetism, revelational methodology,
and prophecies” (2003: 15). History is thus reduced to a clash
of distinct and antagonistic religious cultures. In fact, Hindu
nationalist history is ahistorical— contexts are unimportant in
the larger perpetual war of religions. Islam or Christianity or
Hinduism remain unchanging beasts.
History is fodder for Hindu nationalists; it allows them to
situate their contemporary demands and desires as an inevitable
product of historical animosity suffered by Hindus in the face
of foreign invasions. Muslims pose a threat because of Islam;
Islam poses a threat today because it has always posed a threat.
Negating the actual messy and complicated history of centuries
of conflict, cooperation, trade, mysticism, social change, and

political evolutions, Hindutva focuses almost exclusively on
violence as the driver of history. “Is there an existence of a globally well-established ‘Kafir-Jihad’ behaviour pattern throughout
the Islamic history?” asks a commonly available pamphlet from
RSS shops (Krishnaswami n.d.: 1). It then goes on to answer in
the affirmative by delving into the history of Islam and providing a “catalogue of crimes.” The pamphlet narrates a history
of Hindu-Muslim historical clash and relies upon selective
quotes from Western and Indian scholars. It is worth noting
that Hindutva while claiming to protect indigenous knowledge
from foreign influences has no qualms in validating its narrative of hate by relying upon Orientalist and right-wing Western
commentators. Koenrad Elst (http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org)
and Francois Gautier (http://francoisgautier.wordpress.com)
are favorites on many Hindutva online forums.
The pamphlet of Krishnaswami starts its story of the “Islamic
Dark Age” thus, “Since 712 AD parts of India have been under
the Islamic theocratic rule, that is almost for 1200 years, in this
Islamic dark age Hindus were killed, plundered, taxed, enslaved,
raped and sold by foreign Muslim invaders, for whom the
Jihad against idolater Hindus was a religious duty dictated by
the word of Allah, as stated in Koran” (Krishnaswami n.d.: 6).
History of the emergence of Muslims in India is thus rendered
as a tragedy, as a festering wound on the otherwise continuous
healthy Hindu civilization. History of Islam is nothing but a
history of violence. Events (say, Muslim rulers’ patronage of
temple building) or people (Mughal Emperor Akbar’s efforts
to bring together elements of Islam and other religions in his
Din-i-ilahi) or phenomena (such as Sufism) that do not conform to the Hindu nationalist version of History are rejected as
secular fallacies, Marxist distortions, or Islamic smokescreens.
Centuries of rule by various Muslim dynasties, often competing with each other violently, thousands of instances of Hindu
elite collaborating with Muslim rulers; all these are ignored to
come up with a simple stark picture of Muslim oppression of
Hindus. Any other version of history is rejected as a lie. For
instance, many Hindutva Web sites and commentators quote
Gautier’s conclusion approvingly—that the collective memory

of “genocide perpetrated by the Muslims” has been erased
in India by the secular establishment to appease minorities
(quoted in Krishnaswami n.d.: 14).
The threat posed by Christianity to India is no less real for
Hindu nationalists (see Chowgule 1999; Desai 1997). Paliwal
portrays the history of Christianity as a saga of duplicity and
violence, “They came with the Cross in one hand and sword in
the other” (2003: 31).The focus here is less on history and more
on how Christianity is spreading in recent times.
Calling a Spade a Spade: Religion as the Root of Evil
“If Muslims give up Koran, they can become Indians,” thundered Dr Vedanti, a Hindu sadhu, in a public gathering on
December 6, 2005, celebrating the destruction of Babri mosque.
Since the belief in the Qur’an is essential to Islam, according
to the likes of Vedanti, a Muslim has to commit apostasy in
order to become an Indian. Being secular or agnostic is not
enough—individuals have to renounce beliefs that make them
Muslim. Hindu extremists often scavenge upon ex-Muslims but
are in selective in this—the rationalist, humanist, secular, and/
or liberal motivations of writers like Anwar Shaikh (1994, 1999,
2001) or Hamid Dalwai (1972) in criticizing Islam is ignored;
what is emphasized is their critique of Islam only. That a similar
critique of Hinduism from a humanist and rationalist perspective will deny the very basis of Hindu nationalism is conveniently forgotten. That fundamentalism or religious extremism
can be found in the history and philosophy of all religions is not
acknowledged by Hindu nationalists.
Hindutva spares Jesus Christ from most of its venom. But
it does focus on intolerance implied in monotheism. Why this
antipathy to Islam and Prophet Muhammad? This is because for
Hindu nationalism the problem lies with original Islam itself,
not with its myriad manifestations or (mis)interpretations.
We are often told that Muslims are peace-loving people and
only the terrorists are misinterpreting Islam, but if we study
Islamic theology, we shall know for certain that there is nothing

called peace-loving Muslim or terrorist Muslim’, rather whoever
believes in the Qur’an and hadiths are either real terrorists or
potential terrorist and all those people who believe in Islam
cherish a single desire in their hearts: destruction of all nonMuslims and Islamising the whole world.
(A Board of Experts n.d.)

In the mainstream public discourse in India (as in the West),
violence justified in the name of Islam is understood in terms
of extremist rather than moderate Islam, as a fundamentalist
fringe versus the majority peace-loving Muslims. Except for
the extreme Islamophobes, the consensus is to blame Islamic
fundamentalism and not Islam per se. Hindu nationalists reject
this distinction between moderate and extremist Islam—Islam
is nothing but extremism for them. For instance, the Global
Hindu Heritage Foundation, claiming to “preserve, protect
and advance Hinduism,” exhorts Hindus to protest against
Maharastra government’s ban on an anti-Islam tract titled
“Islam: A Concept of Political World Invasions by Muslims”
(Bhasin n.d.) because the tract is held as exposing “nearly ten
centuries of the atrocities of Muslim rule in India and the
passages [from Qur’an] that support the terror and violence”
(Islam Watch 2008).
“Islamism is a self-righteous psychology and a closed cultural attitude which makes it impossible for its converts to
coexist peacefully and with dignity with other people” (Goel
n.d.b.)—such an attitude toward Islam (for Hindutva, Islam,
Islamism, and Islamic fundamentalism are one and the same
thing) leaves no room for Muslims to escape the charges of
fundamentalism. Therefore, individual Muslims cannot but be
fundamentalist and regressive within the Hindutva worldview.
Krishnaswami encourages his readers to recognize that any
disagreement with the Hindutva view is a sign of the inferiority
complex suffered by non-Muslims on account of living under
Muslim rule—“Dhimmitude [slavish mentality of second-class
non-Muslim citizens of Islamic states and of ‘pseudo-secular’
politicians and media] will never pay, therefore always call a
spade a spade” (Krishnaswami n.d.: 28–29).

Thus, on Islam and Muslims, unlike many contemporary
liberal hawks who might say that it is not Islam as a religion
that is a problem but perversion or radicalization of the
religion by a minority within Islam, Hindutva calls for what
it says is an honest assessment of the “Muslim problem.”
It blames Islam as a religion for all the ills faced by nonMuslims. Hindutva writings seek to dispel any erroneous
notion that it is the perversion of Islam by self-seeking fundamentalism that leads to Islamist violence; according to them
Islam is nothing but cruelty and violence. Jaydeep Sen in his
pamphlet argues that the Islamic Jihad stands for “slaughter of non-Muslims, loot and arson of the kafirs’ property
and rape of their women” and cutting across the national,
regional, linguistic, and other forms of diversity, “unique
uniformity in the behaviour-pattern of the followers of ‘Allah
and His Prophet’ can be explained only by an unbiased analysis of Islam in the light of the Qur’an which forms the Muslim
psyche” (Sen 2001: 2).
Lest one thinks this is a rant of a single extremist, one only
needs to browse through scores of books, information booklets, pamphlets, and leaflets available from shops and establishments run by different components of the Sangh Parivar.
Krishnaswami (n.d.: 2) explains in gory details how the “entire
Koran is a manual on Jihad” and requests every intellectual to
read the Qur’an and dispel themselves from “pseudo-secular
propaganda that all religions preach peace and brotherhood”
and “cure themselves of Gandhi’s syndrome, the ‘Sarva Dharma
Sambhava [all religions are one].’” If only people familiarize themselves with the Qur’an, they will be awakened to the
danger posed by today’s Muslims. Hindutva warns against
trusting anything Muslims say or do because of the legacy
of the Qur’an. For instance, expanding on what he claims to
be the Islamic doctrine of permanent war, Sen warns against
trusting any Muslims’ peace offering because “it is strictly
prohibited for a Muslim to befriend a non-believer or make
peace with him except temporarily, when it is in the interest
of Muslims”(2001: 7). Islam and peace therefore cannot go
together, in the Hindutva worldview.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

A favorite tactic of some Hindu nationalist intellectuals
is to selectively pick up, translate, and highlight those ayats
that discuss how to wage wars against the infidels and thus
to make it clear to the reader that the religion they are dealing with is backward, vicious, irredeemable, and a dangerous
enemy. Krishnaswami (n.d.: 19–25) argues that Islam divides
into three incompatible and hostile parts:space (Dar-ul-Islam
where Sharia rules and Dar-ul-Harb where Kaffirs live), time
(Jahiliya, the age of ignorance; and Ilm, the age of illumination), and mankind (Muslims and Kaffirs). Again, it ignores
the rich debate about the meaning of verses or concepts that
has taken place within Islam across the globe (see Armstrong
2006; Bakhtiar 2007; Barlas 2002; Dawood 1956; Khalidi 2008;
McAuliffe 2006; Muir 1988; Pickthall 1930; Ramadan 2007;
Rustomji 2007; Sachedina 2006; Saeed 2008). That words and
verses should be interpreted within the context or that they
acquire a very different meaning if read on their own or that
meanings can get lost or gained in the process of translation
from Arabic—none of these matter for Hindu nationalism.
According to Hindu nationalists, Islam’s “problem” emerges
from the revelation (Qur’an) as well as the person to whom
it was revealed—Prophet Muhammad. During my research,
Hindu nationalists did not criticize Allah—in fact, they often
presented themselves as magnanimous enough to include Allah
as one of the many gods, if only Muslims were willing to accept
this—but the Prophet. They reject as a secular or Marxist
conspiracy, the historical body of scholarship that situates
violence or temple destruction during the Muslim rule within
non-religious socio-politico-economic practices of the time.
Violence against non-Muslims stems from the Prophet and
the origin of Islam itself. Anwar Shaikh, quoted extensively by
Hindu nationalists, argues that the reason Muslims destroyed
Hindu temples was “psychological, whose roots go back into
the ambitions [Dominance Urge] of the Prophet Muhammad
himself ” (2001: 1). Prophet Muhammad is represented as
uniquely ambitious and ruthless in his pursuit of power
and the whole of Islam and Islamic history of more than a
millennium is subsumed under this representation. According

to Shaikh, “Islam is essentially the cult of Muhammad-worship” and the Prophet’s megalomania is so great that instead
of him worshiping Allah, “in Islam, both angels and Allah
worship Muhammad by praying peace to him!” (Shaikh 2001:
11). Shaikh claims to recuperate God from the Prophet and
says that the Muslims “had no quarrel with India on account
of a Universal God. Their dispute centred around Muhammad
who declared that faith, without believing in him along with
Allah, was useless” (Shaikh 2001: 20). Such analysis of the
Prophet and Islam is taken up by Hindutva as revealing the
true face of their enemy. It performs two moves at the same
time—it rejects all cross-cultural or interfaith dialogue with
Muslims as useless and it asserts the supremacy of the more
tolerant Hinduism. In the war of religions, Islam is doomed to
be intolerant and violent.
Fanaticism and Violence
“Muslims are by instinct kattar (fanatic),” “kattarwadi
Mohammedan” (fanatic Muslim)—the notion that Muslims are
fanatic is part and parcel of Hindu nationalism. Their fanaticism is held to flow out of their religion, history, and politics.
Following Elst and other conservative historians, Sen passes
judgment on Muslim rule in India without making a single
exception—it has been “the bloodiest epoch in her [India’s]
annals, and grossly devoid of humanity—the worst suffering
mankind ever experienced anywhere” (2001: 12). Such a reading of Muslim history in India, an Islamophobic interpretation of global events, and a shared intimate “commonsensical
knowledge” work together to equate Islam, Muslims, fanaticism,
and violence.
Vedanti (2005) proclaimed in a public gathering, “Is desh
mein terrorism ka jad musalman, videsh mein terrorism ka jad
musalman, jab tak musalman nahin samapta hoga, terrorism
nahin khatma hoga” (“Muslims are the root of terrorism in
this country, Muslims are the root of terrorism in the foreign
countries; until Muslims are not erased, terrorism will not
end”). This equation of terrorism with Muslims is widespread

in Hindutva. Not only do Hindu nationalists blame the terror
attacks committed by self-identified Islamists on all Muslims,
they also see all political and resistance movements waged
by Muslims everywhere as terrorism. “Muslim terrorism” is
the only lens through which struggles (such as in Kashmir,
Palestine, Chechnya, Xinjiang, Philippines, or elsewhere) are
perceived. The debate, historical as well as contemporary,
around the concept of Jihad and its association with multiple
ways of striving is ignored, and the only meaning of Jihad
for Hindutva is religiously sanctioned violence against nonMuslims. Paliwal argues that Muslims in India wage Jihad
against Hindus and secularist state because Jihad “is the main
mechanism of Islam and a mandatory religious duty of every
Muslim to fight against the Kafirs to change Dar ul Harb into
Dar ul Islam” (Paliwal 2003: 21). Rather than critically approach
the concept of Jihad through a scholarly engagement, Hindutva
ideologues focus on using selective translated quotes from
Islamic texts in a revelatory mode. The revelatory mode of narrating Islamic doctrines allows the Hindu nationalists to hide
their own ideologies and present their prejudices as the truth
about Muslims. In Ayodhya’s Kar Sewak Puram area, Hindu
nationalists have a prototype of a grand temple they envisage
to build on the disputed Babri Mosque-Ram Janmabhumi site.
During my visit there in December 2005, I found no explicit
symbolism that could link the site of the prototype temple with
Hindu nationalism. There was an exception—in a corner of
the main hall, a leaflet in Hindi was available for devotees and
visitors to take away with them. The leaflet did not make a case
for Ram temple as one may have expected given that the location was Ayodhya and the date was December 6 when Hindu
nationalists celebrate the mosque’s destruction. The leaflet
authored by Anand Shankar Pandya (a diamond exporter based
in Mumbai; he is often described as a leading freedom fighter
and writer on the Internet) in Hindi titled Atankwadka Bharat
par aakraman (Terrorism’s Attack on India) opens with a typical Hindutva line: “In the absence of unity, the supremely wise,
strong, and prosperous Hindu society has today become the
world’s most oppressed, poor, and humiliated,” and goes on to

provide a catalogue of terrorist crimes committed by Muslims
against Hindus (Pandya n.d.). The leaflet, with benign pictures
of Lord Rama and an imaginary temple, is far from benign
and polite in its text. It reveals, in graphic description, violence
allegedly perpetrated by Muslims: “In Doda in Jammu, Hindu
children were killed and their meat shoved inside the mouth
of their father and mother. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindu
women have been paraded naked on streets and suffered gang
rape” (Pandya n.d.).
Lest the reader thinks this is a fantasy or a story, the leaflet has
the following sentence written in red ink, “Every word of this
essay is true. You must read it for the security of yourself and
your country.” Thus, it is important to understand that extremist and prejudiced statements and views of Hindu nationalists
do not stem from a misunderstanding of reality but are very
labored and conscious attempts to shape the truth for the wider
society. The main message they give out about Muslims is that
they are violent, unreliable, and hence a threat to personal as
well as national security. Hindu nationalists when presenting
Muslims as a threat, appeal to individual Hindu’s sense of identity (belonging to a collective Hindu society and nation) as well
as personal security (so that individuals realize that the threat is
not only to the collective but also to them or their family). After
ascribing Islam’s historical spread to violence—Krishnaswami
argues that Muhammad succeeded by “recruiting desperadoes
from all over Arabia through lure of loot & free sex and bloodlust” (Krishnaswami n.d.: 27)—Hindutva reminds contemporary Hindus that their property, women, and survival are at
stake in this violent war being waged by Muslims on innocent
Hindus.
Disloyalty
Muslims are not only rejected as fanatics, but also as traitors.
Their loyalty is said to reside elsewhere. Praveen Togadia,
a senior VHP leader, writes in a foreword of an anti-Islamic
book (Bhasin n.d.): “Even in the present India, I for one
strongly apprehend that at least if not 100%, a great percentage

of Muslims continue to owe extra territorial loyalties to Arab
land than to India. In the event of any military conflict between
India and Pakistan, a large number of Indian Muslims may be
expected to aid Pakistan than India.” Togadia’s polemic does
not provide any evidence or the rationale behind equating
the putative loyalty of Indian Muslims to Arab land and to
Pakistan, for Pakistan is not a part of the Arab world. In a public
gathering, Sadhvi Prachi, a Hindutva sadhvi (ascetic), expressed
her anguish with the Muslim traitors, by reciting a verse from
Mirza Ghalib:
Dil ke phaphole jaluthe seene se
Mere ghar mein aag lag gayi ghar ke chiraag se
Barbad chaman ko karne mein jab ek ullu kafi hai
Anjaam e gulistaan kya hoga har shaakh pe ullu baitha hai
(The blistered heart burns in my chest
My home set afire by the lamp within
To destroy a garden, an owl would suffice
What hope then for a place abloom, where owls are perched on
every branch)

The rapturous audience or the speaker herself did not see any
irony in the use of a Muslim poet’s words from a very different
context to denounce the present day Muslims.
“Indian Muslims do not see themselves as Indians; their
allegiance is to Babur and Aurangzeb and not to Bharat mata
[Mother India],” lectured a Hindu sadhu to me (Personal
Interview 2005h). A common abuse for Muslims in India is
that they are “Babar ki aulad” (“children of Babur”). Muslimdominated regions are “mini-Pakistan,” Indian Muslims support
Pakistan during cricket matches, they are a fifth column, their
loyalty is doubtful, many of them work for the Inter-Service
Intelligence (ISI—Pakistan’s intelligence agency)—such notions
of distrust are common among Hindutva activists. The political
struggle waged by Kashmiri Muslims—internally divided along
different ideologies, personalities, and interests, some secular,
some confessional, some nationalist, some Islamist, and some
opportunist—is rejected as the strongest evidence of Muslim
disloyalty toward India. A perceived over-representation of

Muslim gang leaders, especially in the Mumbai underworld, has
fed into the criminalization of Muslims. “Jis thali main khaate
hai, usi main ched karte hai” (“they dig hole in the plate from
which they eat”)—this common Hindi saying was often repeated
by my respondents to signify the treachery of Muslims.
Disloyalty of minority religious communities is represented as not only against the Indian state but also against
Hindu/Indian culture. Hindutva is upset by the fact that Indian
Muslims adopt Arabized or Persian names or take up causes
common to Muslims across geographical regions or Christians
look to European culture as the norm. Conversion is seen as a
rejection and humiliation of Hindu civilization. Paliwal quotes,
out of context from a book by a Benedictine monk who lived in
India as a sannyasi, Bede Griffiths, to argue that Christians are
a problem because they are made to reject their “Indianness.”
Griffiths’s discussion about the practice of early Portuguese
Christian missionaries many centuries ago is presented by
Paliwal as if it is about the contemporary situation:
[The new converts] were given Portuguese names [the first significant move toward spreading Christianity in modern India
took place under the Portuguese rule in Goa] (which they retain
to this day) and compelled to adopt European habits of food
and clothing, which meant that they became “outcastes” [sic] to
the Hindus. Not only were all the forms of religion, liturgy, theology and devotional customs of a rigidly Western pattern, but
also the external forms, churches, statues, paintings and music,
were faithful copies of western models.
(Griffiths, misspelt as Griffith, quoted in Paliwal 2003: 33)

Here we see the “foreign” elements adopted by Indian converts to be a sore point for Hindu nationalists. Do they offer
Indianization of foreign religions as the solution then? No.
Further in the same booklet (as in many other tracts written
by other authors), it is the Indianization of Christianity—for
example, adoption by missionaries of Hindu-style ashrams
and temples with idols of Jesus and Mary, using incense and
chants—that is seen as a greater danger and as “a fraud which
should be exposed” (Paliwal 2003: 43).

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

One could assess Indianization of Christianity as a healthy
development, as religion responding to the needs of the context, as sacred being brought closer to the people. But Hindutva
does no such thing. Christians in India have no way of escaping
Hindutva rhetorical attacks. If they adopt “foreign” Christian
names or cultural practices, they are accused of rejecting their
Indian heritage; if they indigenize Christianity, instead of being
praised for adapting their religion into the Indian context, they
are attacked for using smokescreens and fooling people. Goel
attacks the following as a conspiratorial strategy—“Hinduising
the outer accoutrements of Christian priests, liturgy and sacraments in order to convince the Hindus that Christianity is not
an imported creed, and that Christianism is not out to corrode Hindu culture” (Goel n.d.b.). Hindu nationalism finds
the Indianization (and even quasi-Hinduization) threatening
because it challenges the neat picture of Muslims and Christians
as foreign to the Hindu body politic.
The issue of trust comes up again and again in the discussions. A Hindutva pamphleteer claims to have used a record in
the India Office Library (“Mss-2397”) of a British officer from
the First World War to narrate an incident after which “the
British never deployed the Hindu and the Muslim soldiers
of the British Indian Army on the same front.” In this supposed incident in Crimea, Muslim soldiers “stationed behind
the Hindu soldiers, shot them at the back and killed many”
because they did not “want to fight the Turks who were on
the side of the Germans and who were holding Crimea” (Sen
2001: 42). I have failed to find any material to corroborate
this statement given as historical evidence by this ideologue.
Either Sen has got hold of a historical document missed out by
all serious historians or he is making this up. The diatribe in
this pamphlet (Sen 2001) comes from a liberal plagiarizing of
other Hindutva writings, all of which warn against threatening
minorities/foreign religionists. This threat is represented as
active and not passive, as expansionary and not localized. Goel
reminds his readers that “Hindu society has to realize that
Christianity and Islam are not religions but political ideologies inspired by imperialist ambitions. These ideologies came

to India as accomplices of Islamic and Western armies,” (Goel
n.d.a) and the story of origin of these religious ideologies is
tied into the story of their spread in India.
Expansionary Impulse of Semitic Religions: Conversion
Ashok Singhal in a pamphlet tells everyone, “Contemporary
Pakistan and Bangladesh are unfortunate examples of India
partitioned on account of religious conversions . . . Today
India’s North Eastern region has come under Church’s control”
(Singhal n.d.: 2). Muslims have no option but to expand their
religion—expansionism is at the core of Islam, according to
Hindutva ideologues. That there is a well-thought, vigorously
executed strategy of Muslims to Islamize India is beyond the
realm of debate for Hindu nationalists. This Islamization is
supposed to occur through calculated demographic growth
and through Jihad. Overpopulation imagery will be discussed
later in the next chapter. Jihad, as we saw earlier, according to
Hindutva is nothing but violence; it is to “wage a relentless religio-political war against the infidels . . . and their government to
Islamize the rest of India and establish here Nizam Mustafa—the
rule of the Prophet” (Paliwal 2003: 21). What propel Muslims
in their “jihadi expansionism” are religious ordinances, carnal
gratification, and booty, and this mode of expansionism is not
only condoned by Islam but also held as a great virtue, claims
Sen (2001: 9–10). Such statements are meant to remind Hindus
that they should not be relaxed about the numerical minority
status of Muslims or Christians since the Semitic religions of
Islam and Christianity have expansionism as well as monotheism as their central pillars. Gandhi’s “sarva dharma samabhava”
(equal treatment of all religions) is rejected as self-defeating by
Hindu nationalists.
Following in the footsteps of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century Shuddhi (Purification) movement, contemporary Hindu nationalists coax and pressurize Indian converts
to Christianity and Islam, especially the recent ones or those
held as practising the “incomplete” form of any religion. They
are encouraged to “purify” and come “back” to the Hindu fold.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Hindutva sees this as a legitimate reaction to counter the missionary impulse of Islam and Christianity. Instances of nonMuslims, especially white Westerners, adopting Hindu practices
are praised as validation of the greatness of Hinduism. However,
conversion from Hinduism into Islam or Christianity is held as
a wound.
Agency is denied to the Indian converts in this game of conversion and reconversion. Their decision to convert is ascribed
to their innocence, stupidity, cowardliness, greed, or opportunism; never to a conscious well-intentioned search for a faith
that provides better meaning in this world or afterlife. This is
obvious from Goel’s rant, “No lie was vile enough in the service
of Christian ‘truth.’” No fraud was foul enough in the service of
Christian ‘virtue’” (Goel n.d.b.) or Paliwal’s assessment that the
target of Christian organizations is mostly “tribals, poor and
gullible” (Paliwal 2003: 33). For Hindu nationalists, Indian converts into Christianity have no independent will except being
greedy for rewards offered by missionaries.
Hindutva has appropriated the term “crypto Christians”
to suit its own worldview. Ignoring the original implication
of crypto Christianity as involving secrecy and camouflaging
to escape persecution and death, Hindu nationalists use it to
designate opportunism and self-interest. To Hindu nationalists,
crypto Christians are those Dalits and tribals who have recently
converted into Christianity or Islam but hidden this fact so that
they continue benefiting from state-provided affirmative action
programs for low-caste Hindus. “Six crore crypto Christians
today retain Hindu name and Hindu caste to enjoy luxuries by
snatching it away from Hindu dalits” (Singhal n.d.: 15). While
Hindu nationalists in private conversations often reject affirmative action for marginalized castes as divisive and anti-Hindu,
Singhal has no qualms in criticizing Christianized Dalits and
tribals for taking away from the limited pie hitherto available
for Hindu Dalits and tribals.
In case any person believes that religious conversion is no
big deal, Singhal has this warning: “With conversion India’s
geography will remain intact but its nationhood, dignity and
culture won’t. After religious conversions here the temples

won’t remain places of worship but mere museums” (Singhal
n.d.: 3–4).
National Insecurity
Hindu nationalists argue that Muslims encourage separatism
in several places, including Kashmir, while Christianity adds
fuel to anti-India insurgency in the North East. Conversion
is a hot topical issue in many states of India, but nowhere as
much as in the northeastern states for here it is projected as a
national security concern. In fact, the dominant threat posed
by Christianity according to Hindu nationalists is conversion in
this politically sensitive region. The mass conversion in northeastern states of India is seen as the most dangerous for that
maps onto anti-India insurgencies taking place there. Again,
no room is available to analyze if these insurgencies are fuelled
by political, economic, and historic grievances and demands
that have nothing to do with religion. Rebels are portrayed as
ungrateful antinationalists, an increasing number of which are
subscribing to the foreign religion of Christianity. Church and
insurgency are perceived through the same lens.
Another example of Hindutva scavenging on a manufactured panic can be seen with regard to “Operation Topac.”
A quick online search will give an impression that Operation
Topac is the name of an actual conspiracy plan hatched by
Pakistan’s General Zia ul Haq in 1988 to Islamize Kashmir and
break India up; this plan was leaked and published first in the
Indian Defence Review in 1989. However, this is a false story.
Serious doubts have been raised about the veracity of this
plan (see Dittmer 2004: 12; Schofield 2003: 141). It was only
a hypothetical military exercise. While the journal that had
published it the first time, Indian Defence Review, now accepts
that it had “war-gamed and published in July 1989 the anticipated course of action by Pakistan in Kashmir under the title
OP TOPAC” (“OP TOPAC: The Kashmir Imbroglio” 2007),
the official Web site of the Indian armed forces continued to
present it as a fact, at least until 2009 (http://armedforces.nic.

works but can be accessed through the online tool of wayback
machine—http://www.archive.org/web/web.php). This mythical operation, however, was referred to as tangible proof of
Pakistan’s nefarious intentions by a number of my Hindutva
respondents.
While this “plan” had been picked up by mainstream media
and defense commentators who are not directly connected to
Hindutva (Chadha 2005: 123), Hindu nationalists have allowed
their fantasy to run wild with it. “Operation Topac” is presented
as an example of Pakistan’s “proxy war” strategy by defense
analysts in India. For Hindu nationalists, the “game” aspect of
the “war game” is dropped conveniently and the focus shifts
from Pakistan’s proxy war in Kashmir to the balkanization of
India. For them “Operation Topac” is the evil of Islam at its
purest—spreading the virus throughout the country starting
with the only Muslim-majority state of India. From a specific
operation to take over Kashmir, it became one to Islamize
Kashmir, and then very soon to Islamize various parts of the
Indian territory and balkanize the country. Hindu nationalists
added layers to this story. For instance, Paliwal quotes a person
named Nawabzada Nabiullah Khan from a Baluchi magazine
of 1999,—“The ultimate aim of Operation Topac is to make
India a million pieces so that it is easy for Pakistan to swallow
India once [sic] piece at a time”(Paliwal 2003: 2). This Islamist
man goes on to give his wish list for Islamizing India: “Our
vision is to make the entire India, 100% Muslim Nation . . .
When you make an unequivocal statement that only Muslim
are voters and declare that India is Islamic Republic, then automatically the people will become Muslims” (quoted in Paliwal
2003: 23). A search on the Web to verify the source takes us only
to Hindutva Web sites that use the name Nawabzada Nabiullah
Khan (see Hindu Voice 2002). I could not find any other source
to verify whether this man exists or has been fabricated by
Hindu nationalists.
Hindu nationalism is, therefore, a discourse of anxiety that
stems from the fear of dangers posed by dangerous minorities. The politics of fear and danger is multifaceted as actually

existing religious minorities are represented in specific ways.
For the Hindu nationalists, it is the Muslims who are seen as

India. The title of a Hindu nationalist pamphlet encapsulates
Hindutva’s paranoia—Vishwawyapi Muslim Samasya (“The
Global Muslim Problem,” Madhok 2003).

hile the “Muslim terrorist” is constructed as a grave
threat to the national security of India as well as to the
personal security of Hindus by the Hindu nationalists, this is
not the biggest danger. In the long term, what is seen as even
more lethal to the existence of the Hindu nation is the specter
of “overpopulating Muslims.” Islam is said to pose a threat
to Hindus not only through tools of fear, but also through
attraction. Muslims seduce the Hindus through propaganda,
lies, money, and the promise of a better life. To repeat my
disclaimer—I do not imply that Muslims seduce Hindus or
have launched demographic warfare. I am identifying and critically analyzing stereotypes marshalled within Hindu nationalism and for the sake of uninterrupted flow, I avoid peppering
the text with “according to Hindutva” or “in the Hindu nationalist view”; but these qualifiers are implied in all Islamophobic
statements here. Another warning is about language—impolite
quotations from hate-filled pamphlets or lascivious views from
Hindutva activists are being used. Without quoting them, the
offensive strand of Hindu extremism cannot be identified or
challenged.
A key plan of Muslims, according to Hindutva ideologues,
is to “allure, attract and abduct young Hindu girls for marriage to the Muslims” (Paliwal 2003: 24). Statements such
as this reveal what Hindu nationalism sees as the primary

enemy—a certain stereotype of vile and virile Muslim masculinity. Fear, disgust, and desire work together in creating
the image of “the Muslim,” a stereotyped Muslim hypersexual
masculine figure that performs the function of the constitutive
Other against which the new Hindu (read Hindutva) Self is
called for. In this chapter, I will first identify and critique the
“overpopulation threat” and then examine the pornosexual
explanation of this threat as provided by Hindu nationalist
activists and ideologues.
In a pamphlet, Krishnaswami reminds his readers that the
Muslims are said to have proclaimed after 1947 that “Hans ke
liya hai Pakistan, Lad ke lenge Hindustan” (“Taking of Pakistan
was like a child’s play, we will now fight and take India”) and
they are implementing the slogan by:
(a) Conducting Information war: i.e. Buying out writers,
journalists and film makers and placing them strategically inside the print, cinema and electronic media so that
“kafirs” can be brain-washed and duped into believing that
Islam is a religion of peace.
(b) Launching Demographic war: Seducing and marrying Hindu
girls and displaying them as proud jihad trophies i.e., jihad
through “love”; rejecting population control measures, and
encouraging infiltration in order to reduce the majority of
“Kafirs” into the minority of “dhimmis.”
(c) Organizing proxy war: i.e. spreading terror so that they
can bleed the Hindu society and nation through thousand
cuts.
(Krishnaswami n.d.: 41; emphases added)

During my fieldwork, conversations about “the Muslim”
almost always turned into what I would call pornonationalism. While the public aspect of Hindutva discourse
is consciously asexualized, “the Muslim” has a conspicuous
dimension of pornosexuality for the ordinary young Hindu
male activists. Using jokes, slogans, gossip, public speeches,
and pamphlets as ethnographic resources, this chapter will
chart the framing of the “overpopulating Muslim” as the gravest threat to India. The sexual dimension of the Hindutva

discourse is relevant not only as ethnographic curiosity but is
politically salient too. A narrative common among Hindutva
intellectuals, leaders, and activists across the country was that
of a conscious Muslim ploy to seduce “innocent” Hindu girls.
The imagination of the Muslim as a hypersexualized overpopulating Other allows Hindutva to frame itself as a defensive
legitimate reaction.
The Mother of All Conspiracies: Demographic Warfare
For Hindu nationalism, violence, religious conversion, and
illegal infiltration are three of the four main tools deployed by
Islam and Christianity to defeat Hindus and take over India.
Illegal infiltration by Bangladeshi Muslims is presented as an
important way in which India is being swamped. It is difficult to
estimate the veracity of different figures on illegal Bangladeshis
in India; but this uncertainty has offered even greater space
for Hindu nationalists to whip up hysteria. By assigning the
vices of illegality, parasitism, disloyalty, and overpopulation
to Bangladeshi Muslim migrants, Hindu nationalist discourse
adds to their representation as national security threat, especially in the border areas. The movement of Bangladeshis is
not seen in terms of flight of the poor to relatively richer areas
in search for livelihood; all individual migrants are reduced
to being part of a conspiracy to create “Greater Bangladesh”
or pockets of “mini-Pakistans.” Singhal reminds his readers of
“a vast conspiracy to bring and settle in infiltrators” aided and
abetted by secularist political rulers who are either ignorant or
complicit (Singhal n.d.: 4).
However, illegal infiltration is seen as less of a problem
than the fourth and most pernicious mode of expansion—
conscious overpopulation. The Hindutva propaganda machinery is obsessed with the idea of a demographic conspiracy being
waged against Hindu India, especially by Muslims. According
to a 2001 census, of the total population in India, 80.5 percent
were Hindu, 13.4 percent Muslim, 2.4 percent Christian, 1.8
percent Sikh, 0.8 percent Buddhists, 0.4 percent Jains, 0.6 percent other religions and persuasions, and 0.1 percent religion

not stated (Census of India 2001). In 1951, the first Census of
independent India, the Hindu share was 84.9 percent, Muslim
9.9 percent. This rise of the Muslim population from 9.9
percent to 13.4 percent in 60 years is seen by Hindutva as part
of a demographic warfare in which the enemy is increasing its
numbers consistently. This warfare is seen as a product of high
fertility sanctioned by religion, culture, and sexual behavior of
Muslims. A pamphlet claims to quote from Thomas Patrick
Hume’s Dictionary of Islam on Prophet Muhammad’s view
on the desirability of fertility in women: “Men should marry
those women who will love their husbands and produce many
children. Because I want my people to be more in numbers
than others” (Anon. n.d.: 9). It then goes on to use this “quote”
to support its case that high population growth of Muslims in
India is therefore not a product of socioeconomic backwardness but a religiously sanctioned cultural trait.
The fear of demographic siege has a century-long history
in India. U. N. Mukherji’s analysis of Hindus as a dying race
in 1909, “they count their gains, we calculate our losses” (in
Elst 1997) was just the start. Suresh Das, a Hindu nationalist religious leader, explained to an admiring public in his
speech in Hardwar in December 2005 that Muslims are not
bothered about how to take care of their numerous children.
All they want is to increase their number so they can overtake
Hindus, control India, and then seize Hindu properties and
women: “roti, beti, zameen loot lenge” (“We will loot your food,
daughters, and land”) (Das 2005b).
Different Hindutva commentators flag up different estimates
of when Hindus will lose their majority or when will they have
to concede another partition or when will they be decimated.
Wild imaginations run riot as critical faculties are suspended
and Hindu nationalists scramble to come up with ever more
dire nightmarish scenarios. Paliwal cites different studies that
predict Muslims attaining the “magic number” of 33 percent
plus (the same as when India was partitioned in 1947) in 2151,
a non-Hindu majority in India by 2300, decimation of Hindus
by 2300, or a Muslim majority by the turn of the twenty-second
century and says that one thing is certain, “Hindu population is

decreasing, and that of Muslims is explosively increasing” (2003:
28–29; emphasis added). Can one rely on these predictions
that are so different from each other? Such questions are never
asked within the Hindutva worldview. Therefore, Paliwal, who
cites different figures in his pamphlet, concludes with his truth,
“A regular decline in the Hindu population in any country leads
to the annihilation of the Hindus and Hindu dharma. Such a
demographic imbalance in the Hindu-Muslim population first
leads to minoritization of the Hindus and in India it is likely to
take place within next 2–3 decades” (2003: 6). On what basis
does he choose to predict two to three decades when all the
studies he himself quotes give a date a couple of centuries later?
Paliwal is not exceptional in his conjuring up a figure from the
air. A close study of most Hindutva commentators reveals that
the absence of evidence is never allowed to come in the way
of their already formed conclusion about being besieged; the
lack of evidence is itself ascribed to the secularist conspiracy.
All studies that confirm the prejudices are taken as proof while
those that challenge them are rejected as pseudo-secularist
conspiracy.
In recent years, Hindu nationalists have jumped upon a
study of religious demography by Joshi et al. (2003) to bolster their case of demographic warfare. This is the same study
mentioned earlier in which the Home Minister of India Lal
Krishna Advani had written a foreword. Joshi et al. (2003) claim
to provide a “systematic” analysis of religious demography of
India, an analysis that then has provided fodder and “scientific”
validation to already held prejudices of Hindu nationalists.
They distinguish between Islam, Christianity, and the rest collectively termed as “Indian religionists” (including Hindus,
Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, and even Parsis and Jews). On what
basis is this distinction of Indian and foreign religionists made?
For a study claiming to be systematic, it is significant that no
justification is provided for the very basic categories of identity
that are being deployed. The tension within the categories and
subcategories are ignored. One wonders how to explain the
appropriation of Buddhists within “Indian religionists,” ignoring the contempt toward it shown by some Hindu nationalists

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

(Champat Rai, a RSS leader I met in Hardwar, pointed out to
me that “Buddhists disappeared in eighth century because they
were anti,” Personal Interview 2005f).
There is a pathological fear of heterogeneity as the infusion
of Islam and Christianity is represented as ending an “almost
timeless consensus on fundamental civilization principles . . .
collectively known by the name of sanatana dharma” (Joshi
et al. 2003: 6) that was aided by geographically natural entity
and impregnable frontiers. Their main argument is that Indian
religionists will become less than 50 percent of the total population just before 2061. The prediction assumes that there will
not be any variation in the rate of population growth between
2001 and 2061; that increasing literacy, urbanization, and economic wellbeing will not have an impact on the rate. Without
acknowledging it, the study assumes that the demographic
trend associated with socioeconomic change that is widely
held to be a key determinant in the decline of the rate of population growth, will bypass Indian Muslims. Socioeconomic
determinants (could the higher Muslim fertility be ascribed
to the fact that more Muslims are illiterate, socioeconomically backward?), regional, and intra-community variations
(is the fact that Muslims in South India have lower fertility
than both Hindus and Muslims in the more populous and
backward North India not significant?), or the absence of a
sound scientific basis to link religion and fertility in demography have been ignored in this study by Joshi et al. A close
reading of the study thus reveals it to be a polemic rather than
a work of scholarship. The reason I mention it here is because
of the widespread reliance on it within Hindutva tracts as the
authoritative proof of the Hindu nationalist’s case of demographic siege.
The most problematic category Joshi et al. use is “India.”
They use “India” for the subcontinent comprising present day
India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan and “Indian Union” for the
state of India. It is interesting how more extremist commentators dispense with this distinction between India and Indian
Union and appropriate Joshi et al.’s dubious study to exaggerate
the decline of “Indian religionists.” A typical Hindu nationalist

pamphlet presents as a fact the statement that by the middle
of twenty-first century, Indian religionists will be almost 50
percent in India, and this is a reduction from 79.32 in 1901 to
58.5 percent in 2050. (Anon. n.d.). It conveniently forgets to
mention that they use “India” for contemporary India along
with Pakistan and Bangladesh). Even more stark is the case of
deliberate manufacturing of paranoia in Mughalistan (2007).
Joshi et al. point out that between 1900 and 1990, the Muslim
share in the population of “India” (India-Pakistan-Bangladesh
combined) has increased from 22 percent to 30 percent while
that of the Hindu has declined from 77 to 68 percent. But
Mughalistan (2007) quotes from another article titled “Deathly
Demographic Warnings for India” that the “total Muslim population zoomed from 12.5% (1991) to 30.3% (2001) in just 10
years”—they take the rough figure of 1991 for the Indian Union
(12.5%) and of 2001 (30.3%) from India-Pakistan-Bangladesh
and cry hoarse that Muslims have increased almost threefold in
a decade. Such “mistakes” are not accidental but calculated to
fool the readers and alarm them.
The certainty of demographic decline remains untouched by
alternative evidence. Unless the Hindus retaliate in this demographic game, they will be reduced to a minority status—“jis din
hindu alpasankyak ho jayenge, Musalman beti, roti, aur makaan
loot lenge” (“The day Hindus become a minority, Muslims will
plunder our daughters, food, and houses,” Das 2005a; Suresh
Das, a charismatic Hindu sadhu, focused obsessively on the loot
of Hindu women and property in his two speeches delivered in
two different towns 2005a and 2005b). Hindu nationalist leaders
as well as activists love to repeat one or the other variation of
the following saying:—“Hum do, hamare do [Hindus follow the
Indian state family planning model of two child], Hum paanch,
hamaare pacchis [Muslim men do not follow the family planning and each have four wives and 25 children].” These slogans
can be found online, in private conversations with activists and
sympathizers, in public forums and speeches. “‘Hum do hamare
do’ slogan is meant only for Hindu society . . . Who will then
protect the state and religion?”, asks VHP leader Singhal in a
widely circulated tract (Singhal n.d.: 18).

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Fantasy overdrive of Hindu nationalists is best exemplified by
a map allegedly proving the demographic conspiracy—the map
is a pictorial representation of a plan for “Mughalistan” (also
spelled “Mughalstan”), an independent homeland for Muslims
in India. I first came across the map printed on the back cover
of Paliwal (2003), ascribed to “Mughalstan Research Institute”
(MRI) of Jehangir Nagar and then later in greater detail on the
Web site Mughalistan (2007). Was this a fiction concocted by
Hindu nationalists? Research on this threw interesting light on
the fantasy-machinery of Hindutva and let me indulge in it.
Original reference to this “plan” was first made not as a
warning on Hindutva Web sites, but as a campaign on a Dalit
(treated as “outcastes” or untouchables in Hindu caste system)
activist Web site, www.dalitstan.org. This Web site has been
taken down since the middle of 2006 and was one of the sites
blocked by the Indian government as a hate site; it is no longer
alive and its retrieval was made possible thanks to http://web.
archive.org. The main dalitstan.org Web site was created in May
1999 and disappeared in May 2006 and was a portal for espousing anti-India Dalit nationalism but also acted as a forum for
anti-India Christian and Muslim advocacy. Research using web.
archive.org shows that the link to a separate section on Muslims
(which when alive would have taken the readers to a dedicated
site of Hezb-e-Mughalstan, the Party of Mughalstan, http://
web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.dalitstan.org/mughalstan)
appeared around June 2000 on the main site and disappeared soon after 9/11. However, a separate page dedicated to
Mughalstan remained alive until April 2005.
While http://www.dalitstan.org/mughalstan went through
changes in its life span from the middle of June 2000 to April
2005 (check http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://dalitstan.org/
mughalstan), it mostly presented itself as a plan to liberate
“Mughal Muslims” in India from Anglo-Brahmanical tyranny
and as “the Muslim response to Hindu Rashtra.” The tone was
defensive. Initially in late 2000, the Web site focused on issues
like “Genocide of Mughal-Muslims,” “Mass murder in Kashmir,”
Bin Laden’s Jihad for Mughalstan (referring to a journalistic
piece from a mainstream magazine India Today, which discussed

Bin Laden’s antipathy to India and focused primarily on Kashmir
and did not mention anything resembling Mughalstan; “We
should now target India” 1999), International Mujahideen, warfare guides, and links to sites including a “Mughalstan Research
Institute: The academic side of the Struggle for Mughalstan”
(MRI) (see http://web.archive.org/web/20000824175046/www.
dalitstan.org/mughalstan). The last hyperlink to MRI would
take the reader to a “Mughalstan Historical Society” (http://web.
archive.org/web/20000818232905/www.freespeech.org/delhi),
which did not provide any map or clue to its physical location
but merely further hyperlinks to documents denouncing Hindu
dark ages, many of them from www.dalitstan.org itself—an
interesting example of two different sites operate in a loop and
validate their views by referring to each other. However, the
link to MRI existed on the Web site very briefly (see the site’s
revamping http://web.archive.org/web/20010413040348/www.
dalitstan.org/mughalstan/ and this remained the format until
the Web site’s death).
The main page on Mughalstan witnessed a shift as three maps
appeared in 2001 including “Mughalstan Map, Mughalstan Res.
Inst., No copyright. 2000,” “Map of Mughalstan by Gulbaz
Khan, Pan-Islamic Mughalstan, Lahore, 2000. Copyright 2000.
All Rights reserved,” and the most detailed one “Proposal for the
Ethnic Partition of South Asia by Jehangir Khan, Mughalistan
Research Institute, No copyright. Jehangirnagar, Bengladesh,
2000AD” (see http://web.archive.org/web/20010413040348/
www.dalitstan.org/mughalstan/). The idea for Mughalstan was
put forward on an anti-India extremist Web site. It is interesting to note that the idea of Mughalstan represents itself as a
response to Hindu nationalism.
But Mughalstan here was not a plan but a manifesto that had
very few subscribers beyond the original Web site. Very few discussion forums seem to pick it up and in most cases, the overwhelming response was to reject it as a fantasy or lunacy. That
was until the Hindu nationalists picked the story, embellished
it, and re-presented it. Mughalstan has acquired a new lease of
life after the closing down of the www.dalistan.org/mughalstan
Web site. This comes not from other Islamists but thanks to

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

endless reference to it in Hindutva writings. The adoption by
the Hindu nationalists of the “plan” from this purportedly Dalit
forum (which saw Muslims and Christians as allies against
Brahmanical Hindus, but ignored class and caste inequalities
among Muslims and Christians) for their own purpose was
highly selective. While references were made in an article in a
Hindi newspaper Amar Ujala on October 6, 2001 (see Bhasin
n.d.) and pamphlets and leaflets thereafter (Paliwal 2003), the
story was reinvigorated after 2007 starting with a reference to
it on www.hindujagruti.org (“New Pakistan—Mughalstan”
2007). But now Mughalstan was no longer a manifesto given on
an extremist Web site, but represented as a well-thought plan of
intelligence agencies of Pakistan and Bangladesh working hand
in glove.
Note how in the most detailed map, “Proposal for the
Ethnic Partition of South Asia by Jehangir Khan, Mughalistan
Research Institute, No copyright. Jehangirnagar, Bengladesh,
2000AD” (see http://web.archive.org/web/20060216083650/
www.dalitstan.org/mughalstan/images/sasia.gif) South Asia is
mentioned, map’s author’s name and the location of MRI both
start with Jehangir (further raising the doubt as to the seriousness of this), and it is not only South Asia but neighboring countries too that are divided (e.g., China into Uighuristan, Tibet,
Ngambon, Huistan, Han China, and Mongolia or Afghanistan
into Baluchistan, Hazaristan, Daristan, and Badakshan). The
manifesto is thus a fantasy of ethnic and not religious enclaves.
Muslims in this map are as divided as Hindus. Clearly for the
cyber activists behind the original map, the only obsession was
Mughalstan spreading from Pakistan to Bangladesh, taking over
most of North India.
But the same map undergoes small, but significant, transformation when it came to be adapted by Hindu nationalists. The
map became one of the “Evil Designs of Destroying India,” the
neighboring countries and their subdivisions disappear thus
giving the impression that this supposed plan is only for India.
As the story circulated, it acquired additional embellishments
and further concretization. This comes out most comprehensively on a blog (Mughalistan 2007) where the vagueness of

previous stories and maps disappear. It is now argued that the
map proves that “the comprehensive plan for a second partition of India was first developed by the Mughalstan Research
Institute (MRI) of Jahangir Nagar University (Bangladesh).”
The use of the name of an actually existing University lends a
certain authority to the conspiracy plan.
This shift from a laughable manifesto presented on an
extremist Web site to a conspiracy hatched allegedly by a
Research Institute of an actual University is a product of Hindu
nationalist imagination. There is no evidence that MRI ever
existed at Jahangir Nagar University—a search on their web site
drew a blank, enquiries from scholars from Bangladesh, including alumni from this university, confirm that they have never
heard of such an institute ever being there. The sly manner in
which Jehangir Nagar was replaced by Jahangir Nagar University
on Mughalistan (2007) and many other Hindu extremist Web
sites reflects the desire of Hindutva to play up the Islamic
threat. This is confirmed by the fact that they underemphasize
the origin of the map on a Dalit nationalist platform.
Moreover, Hindu nationalist Web sites selectively edit out certain parts from the original articles such as “What is Mughalstan?
[A short FAQ on Mughalstan].” Hezb-e-Mughalstan, claiming
to be the owner of www.dalitstan.org/mughalstan, did not deny
the rationale for Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation) but argued that
in places such as Maharashtra or Gujarat dominated by “IndoAryans,” Hindus would be free to create their own nation. The
enemy of that Mughalstan project therefore was the very idea of
secular, multiethnic India. Note that it says, “Establishment of
a Mughalstan would facilitate rather than hinder the establishment of Hindu Rashtra. In this case, the common enemy are
the liberals. Lest we both are annihilated in the multi-cultural
cess-pit, let us save ourselves and our heritage.” (http://web.
archive.org/web/20010128125300/dalitstan.org/mughalstan/
azad/whatisms.html). Clearly Mughalstan proponents had no
serious problems with the Hindu nationalist viewpoint—they
were fellow travellers in the sense that both assumed Hindu and
Muslim categories to be self-evident, mutually exclusive, and
antagonistic. Both saw liberal secularism as the enemy.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Mughalstan thus is a putative plan to create an undivided
Islamic nation by dividing India. To understand what is being
discussed and analyze how various facts, fictions, and lies are
jumbled together to provide a coherent narrative of doom, it is
important to examine samples of the text. I use the text of the
“plan” from the Web site http://mughalistan.wordpress.com
(Mughalistan 2007, accessed 4 July 2009):
Mughalistan (or Mughalstan) is the name of an independent
homeland proposed for the Muslims of India. This MughalMuslim state in the Indian subcontinent will include all of
North India and Eastern India, and will be formed by merging
Pakistan and Bangladesh through a large corridor of land running across the Indo-Gangetic plain, the heartland of India.
This Mughalistan corridor will comprise Muslim-majority
areas of Northern India and eastern India that will be partitioned for the second time in history.
The comprehensive plan for a second partition of India was
first developed by the Mughalstan Research Institute (MRI)
of Jahangir Nagar University (Bangladesh) under the patronage of the two intelligence agencies, Pakistan’s Inter Services
Intelligence (ISI) and Bangladesh’s Director General of Forces
Intelligence, DGFI. The “Mughalistan Research Institute of
Bangladesh” has released a map where a Muslim corridor
named “Mughalistan” connects Pakistan and Bangladesh via
India.
The Pakistani Punjabi-dominated ISI’s influence on the
MRI is evident even in the Punjabi-centric pronunciation of
the word “Mughalstan” (without the “i”), instead of the typical Urdu pronunciation (Mughalistan). Islamic jihadis in India
have been well-armed and well-funded by the neighbouring
Islamic regimes, as part of Operation Topac—the late Pakistani
President Zia-ul-Haq’s grandiose plot to balkanize India . . .
This Islamic beach-head, which squeezes India from both
sides (Pakistan and Bangladesh), gradually links up with a
Fifth Column within India and gains fresh territorial and
demographic victories within the last two decades (Kashmir
valley, several districts of West Bengal and Assam, Malappuram
district in Kerala, and the Hyderabad-Deccan region). The
Islamic Anschluss creeps steadily and bloodily, until the Western

beach-head (Pakistan) is linked up demographically with the
Eastern beach-head (Bangladesh) through the formation of a
Islam-dominated belt called “Mughalstan,” that will then run
through Jammu, Mewat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and
Assam . . .

So here we have a “plan” to link two Muslim-majority countries
to each other by Islamizing a large part of India hatched in a
research institute that does not exist under the patronage of
intelligence agencies of two countries with embittered relations.
The Hindutva subscribers of this imaginary conspiracy are
oblivious to the complexity of Bangladesh politics such as the
fact that the country was created after a revolt against Pakistan,
and has the wound of violent liberation wars etched in the
nationalist memory, or that the country has jostled between
secularism and moderate Islam since its inception. Judging by
the pamphlets and online forums, in their zest to spread the
awareness of this “plot,” Hindu nationalists do not pause to ask
a simple question “If Islam is such a cohesive force that brings
all Muslims together, why do so many Muslim states exist?.” All
Muslims are reduced to a single identity of Islam in this plan and
it is assumed that Muslims, forgetting their linguistic, political,
class, ethnic, gender, and nation differences will rally together
to create an Islamic nation. If Ummah, as a political entity, has
failed to materialize and has remained a vague dream of fraternity in all parts of the world, why would Muslims in South Asia
unite as a single nation? The crisis faced by Pakistan, partly a
legacy of its foundation on a two-nation theory (Hindus and
Muslims as separate nations), is evident to all, except the Hindu
nationalists who hang on to the idea of Hindus and Muslims
as distinct hostile nations. Fragility of Pakistan or Bangladesh
is ignored as they get represented as evil organized enemies. In
case this nexus of Pakistan-Bangladesh-North Indian Muslim
is not threatening enough for the readers, Mughalistan (2007)
mentions that the plan to create “Greater Pakistan to ‘liberate’
the Muslims of India from the Hindus” has the full support of
Osama Bin Laden, the Mumbai underworld led by Dawood
Ibrahim, and numerous Islamist extremist organizations inside

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

India and in neighboring countries. Thus, the picture one gets
is of a solid coalition of Muslim terrorists, extremists, separatists, expansionists, and traitors.
A Muslim becomes a part of this coalition simply by being
a Muslim; she does not have to act in a certain way to be seen
as a part of the conspiracy. Her identity is what marks her as
conspirator. This is illustrated in the analysis of the “Muslim
problem” in Mughalistan (2007). For instance, the presence
of five Muslim members of Parliament and 45 members of
the state’s Legislative Assembly in West Bengal is presented as
a proof of the conspiracy. The fact that the numbers are well
below the Muslim share of population in the state—five out
of 42 MPs is approximately 12 percent, 45 out of 294 MLAs is
15 percent, and the Muslims constitute 30 percent of the total
population—is conveniently unremarked upon.
Mughalistan (2007) ratchets up the rhetoric of this fictive
plan.
In case the ramifications of the unfolding scenario are not
yet clear to Indians, the bomb-blasts and religious riots are a
roaring continuation of the 1400-year Jihad against India—an
ongoing war that will culminate in the Islamisation of what’s
left of Hindustan. Already the demographic battle is underway
and the Mughalistan scenario looks feasible . . .
Lest one mistakenly thinks that Mughalistan is the culmination of the Islamisation of India and that somehow the rest of
India will be spared its fate, it must be stressed that this second
partition of India is only the beginning . . . (There are pockets
in Hyderabad, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala in central
and South India where Muslims are growing faster) . . . The
planning and execution is well underway to ensure a continuing Anschluss where several Muslim majority pockets such as
Moplahstan (in Kerala) and Osmanistan (in the Deccan) will
gradually spread in size and link up with Mughalistan to form
a Greater Mughalistan.
This Greater Mughalistan is of strategic significance as it will
provide a contiguous, strategic corridor linking the Ummah
into a pan-Islamic Caliphate. The ISI-DGFI-Indian Jihadi triumvirate has fondly nicknamed this pan-Islamic Caliphate as
Islamistan (meaning “Land of Islam”), a synonym for “Islamic

Asia, with the new Islamic World stretching all the way from
Morocco and Bosnia in the West to Malaysia and Indonesia in
the East . . .

Here we have a reconfirmation of two pet images of Hindu
nationalism—all South Asian Muslims working together to conspire against Hindus and Islam’s conspiracy against India as part
of its global war of supremacy. The Mughalistan (2007) Web site
and Hindutva commentators are thus using the distorted map
of a fictitious body called MRI to create, consolidate, and spread
their conspiracy theory through different channels. Their hope of
informing their sympathizers is fulfilled as many of my respondents during fieldwork mentioned a “prestigious think tank from
a Bangladeshi university,” which they claimed was working on a
concerted plan to break India up.
Jihad by Seduction
Paliwal, a Hindutva ideologue, criticizes the Hindu social
practice of dowry only because it indirectly helps Muslims
(and Christians) in seducing innocent Hindu girls: one of the
main strategies of Muslims is to “allure the beautiful, educated,
employed, wealthy, as well as poor [Hindu] girls for marriage”
(Paliwal 2003: 11). The handsome Muslim who is a master
in the art of seduction, the lecherous Muslim, and the rapist
Muslim—all these images play upon each other as a danger
for “innocent” Hindu females (see Gupta 2001). This then
encourages the mobilization of Hindu women for Hindutva in
the name of self-defense and protection of the body of Hindu
women and the Hindu nation. More crucially, it exhorts Hindu
men to “protect” their innocent Hindu mothers, sisters, and
daughters.
PT (name withheld), a young VHP activist in a Nagpur
office (Personal Interview 2006) explained the role of the
“Westernized” media and Hindi cinemas (where several
prominent leading actors are Muslim) in portraying sex and

thus putting ideas into the heads of young Hindu girls; a
“good cultured girl will never run away with a Muslim, ” but
if she does, this is because the family is collapsing as women
spend more time in front of the television sets and neglect
their children. The blame and emphasis thus is on a lecherous
Muslim preying upon a Hindu girl, a girl who is more vulnerable due to Westernized media portrayal of sex and because
of mothers neglecting their children for television. Hindutva,
even when extolling women in certain roles (mother, sister,
daughter, ascetic, warrior), never acknowledges their right
over their sexuality. Female sexuality is something that
demands patrolling to prevent it from being exploited by
the Muslim conspiracy to seduce Hindu girls as part of their
wider demographic warfare. The close connection between
demonizing the Muslim and policing (Hindu) woman’s sexuality has been studied in detail (see Bacchetta 2004; Gupta
2001; Sarkar 2002).
The notion of Muslim men preying upon Hindu girls is
common sense in Hindutva thinking. Krishnaswami (n.d.: 22)
reminds his readers that
Wooing Hindu girls, but at the same time compelling their
own sisters to wear burqua [sic] and to stay away from the
Hindu boys, practising polygamy, rejecting population control measures and encouraging cross-border infiltration from
Bangladesh and Pakistan in order to reduce the majority of
kafirs into a minority of Dhimmis by the end of 21st century,
are the demographic dimensions of jihad.

During my field research, in different locations including
Ayodhya, Hardwar, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Nagpur,
I came across localized, “factual,” stories concerning a disconcertingly common theme—kidnapping of Hindu girls.
Everywhere I was told by narrators that they personally knew
of cases where kidnapping of a Hindu girl has been foiled or a
kidnapped girl has been rescued by brave Hindutva activists.
All the stories were uncannily similar; they were variations on
the same theme. This clearly reflects a sharing of vocabulary

of mythmaking. I call it mythmaking because the “factual
accounts” were ridden with inconsistencies, were narrated in a
stylized manner, and in selective cases where I sought to verify
the story, there was no evidence. I am not in a position to
claim with authority that all the stories are false; my research
was not about truth or falsity of Hindutva representations
but the consistencies and inconsistencies in it. The remarkable commonalities in the stories told about “a conspiracy
to kidnap innocent Hindu girls” by activists from different
regions of India implies either of the two things—that there is
a vast conspiracy to Islamize Hindu women, or that there is a
conspiracy to generate paranoia about a conspiracy that does
not exist. My analysis points toward the second option. There
clearly is a general desire, if not a coordinated conspiracy,
within Hindutva to foster fear and paranoia.
Let me give an example of two stories of “kidnapping,” both
narrated by PT (Personal Interview 2006). The first story was
about Hindu girls falling victim to seduction by Muslims.
In Amravati, there was a clear conspiracy to lure Hindu girls
away. Muslim girls would befriend Hindu girls, introduce the
latter to their Muslim brothers and encourage them into having affairs. There will be a kiss, and then the Hindu girl will be
blackmailed, and a blue film will be made. Muslim boys with
new bikes (funded as part of the conspiracy to portray them
as attractive) would attract Hindu girls. Hindu girls would
be married, converted, and then more than 90 percent will be
abandoned. In the second story narrated by PT, the theme is of
rescuing. In a small town close to Nagpur, a Bajrang Dal activist overheard in a public telephone center the plan of a Muslim
man to lure away a Hindu girl—the man was informing his
own Muslim wife of the plan, proving that the Muslim women
are complicit in this type of crime. Al Qaeda offers an award of
Rs 70,000 to lure a single Hindu girl. The Bajrang Dal activist
followed the man, gathered his friends, beat the man up, forced
the girl to have an abortion, and sent her back to her parental
family despite her objection. Both the stories validate Muslim
deviousness and conspiracy and hold Muslim women as partners in crimes committed by Muslim men; neither questions

the “innocence” of the Hindu girl. Could the girl be a willing
partner in this? This question is never asked.
In the second story, the woman was clearly in love, but then
for Hindu nationalists there is no possibility of love without
politics when it comes to Muslim males and Hindu females.
Love is in fact regarded as a conspiracy too—a tool in the hands
of Islamists to wage a “love jihad.” Since early 2009, Hindutva
blogs got animated by the discovery of a love-jihad conspiracy.
Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS), a Hindutva publication, gives
a story where “Love Jihad” is a jihadi organization:
Trapping naive Non Muslim girls in the web of love in order
to convert to Islam is the modus operandi of the said organisation . . . As per the instructions to recruits of this organisation, they have to love a Hindu girl within the time frame of 2
weeks and brainwash them to get converted and marry within
6 months. Special instructions to breed at least 4 kids have also
been given. If the target won’t get trapped within first 2 weeks,
they are instructed to leave them and move on to another girl.
College students and working girls should be the prime target.
Once completed their mission the organisation will give 1 lakh
Rupees and Financial help for the youth to start business. Free
Mobile Phone, Bikes and Fashionable dresses are offered to
them as tools for the mission. Money for this Love Jihad comes
from Middle East. Each district have their own zone chairman’s
to oversee the mission. Prior to College admission they make a
list of Hindu girls and their details and target those whom they
feel vulnerable and easy to be brainwashed.
(“Love Jihad” 2009; more extensive coverage at http://www.
scribd.com/doc/16640747/LJa, accessed 23 July 2009).

This “breaking news story” about the discovery of an organization in Kerala in South India forgets to mention that the “jihad
by love” or “love jihad” is not a new representational motif.
Krishnaswami (n.d.) mentions it and so did a VHP activist
thousands of kilometers to the north of Kerala a couple of years
ago. A VHP activist is quoted in a documentary from 2007
about love in Meerut (a small city in the north Indian state of
Uttar Pradesh) that he knows that there is a conspiracy under

which Muslim boys seduce Hindu girls by assuming false Hindu
identities. By the time the poor girls realize it, they are too far
gone in the relationships. This is “loving jehad,” a no-weapons
terrorism (“Love” 2008). If “love jihad” was already being talked
about, why do Hindutva newspapers and magazines like HJS
present the story from Kerala as breaking news of a discovery?
The purpose is to generate moral panic. The tales about this
conspiracy of jihad by seduction gets circulated through the
media and online blogs. The following “news” item from the
daily Sanatan Prabhat appears on a Web site exhorting Hindus
to unite globally (New Fatwa 2008).
New Fatwa: “Seduce Hindu girls and make them Muslims”
Sambhajinagar (Maharashtra): There is an ordinance stating,
“Attracting the Hindu young girls by your charm lure them
and force them to accept Muslim religion.” Many Hindu
Organisations have made a complaint to the police stating
the above declaration. A Muslim youth who was arrested by
the police told about the ordinance. (O, Hindus! Remember, the
Government would not take any step against this ordinance
that is against Hindus. If you wish to protect yourself from the
Muslims who are bent upon ruining the Hindus in all respect
there is no other alternative but getting united and ready to
fight them!—Editor)
The youth also told the police that each of these Muslim
youths is given Rs. 200 per day for doing this service. (It is quite
evident from this how much hatred towards Hindus they have.
Hindus should decide whether to keep contact with Muslims
anymore or not!—Editor) There is news published by a Daily in
Marathawada stating that similar ordinance is being published
in Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, and Latur and many Muslim youths
are seen moving in groups to achieve their goal. They are also
given two wheelers to facilitate them to allure the girls going to
schools and colleges. One Muslim youth who was seen moving
suspiciously was questioned by some social workers and handed
over to the police by following him when he was trying to run
away. He revealed this shocking conspiracy.

By adding editor’s notes in brackets, HJS laments and reminds
Hindu readers that the problem being discussed is not localized

but part of a vast conspiracy. PT in his interview with
me (Personal Interview 2006) had mentioned the figure of
Rs. 70,000 but had said that the “prize money” offered by Bin
Laden to Indian Muslims varies depending upon the caste and
status of the Hindu girl being lured. Apparently, the amount
of prize money is greater if the girl’s caste is higher. The news
story from the daily Sanatan Prabhat cites no source for the
“ordinance” nor does it show a copy of the ordinance. Within a
month of this story, the HJS Web site gave another sensationalist news to confirm the supposed ordinance. The story goes like
this (Latur 2009):
A news was published recently stating that, every Muslim youth
would be given Rs. 200 every day by Moulavi, a Mohammedan
jurist for alluring the Hindu young girls. 2 Muslim youths were
arrested for putting this order to affect in the police locality
itself. They were caught immediately and beaten and later were
handed over to the police . . .
In Sambhajinagar too the police arrested 6 Muslims. 4
Muslim youths were teasing a young girl in the police locality.
(It is quite evident from this that they are not even afraid of
police while teasing the girl. Will the girls from police families
be safe in such heedless Congress rule?—Editor) Watching
this some Hindu youths objected to them. (Congratulations
to those youths for raising objection to the Muslim youths for
teasing the girls!—Editor) There was altercation between the
two groups. The Muslim youths told them about the order of
the Moulavi. It was news to those Hindus. (Muslims follow the
order blindly. How many Hindus follow the teachings of their
Dharmacharyas?—Editor) The Muslims showed them the cutting of the order. Hindus were not aware of it. (Not to know
such an important order amounts to slumber!—Editor)

Again, this story gets cited on other Hindutva Web sites without
a hint of skepticism. The Muslim youths in this story are presented as merely following the order of a religious leader and
there is lament that Hindus do not do so. Who is this Islamist
leader who has given the alleged order? If Hindu nationalists sincerely believe in this story, why not complain about

this Maulavi to the police? If they are not conjuring this story
up, why not encourage the Hindutva youth to search for the
Maulavi who they accuse of ordering Muslim men to seduce
Hindu girls? They do no such thing because it is clear that they
are indulging in scare mongering. In the blogosphere, the tales
of a love jihad conspiracy circulate without any serious questioning of what the evidence is. One extremist Web site quotes
another, and when you check the second one, they would cite
the first one. Alarmist stories have titles such as “HJS member
saves a Hindu girl from clutches of Muslims” (“HJS member”
2009) or “Muslim abducts a young & married Hindu woman”
(“Muslim abducts” 2009). Hindutva commentators lament the
state of affairs and demand vigilante actions to protect Hindu
women and punish Muslim men but no one calls for unmasking of the Islamist leaders who supposedly gave the order in the
first place. It is clear that endless circulation of stories perform
a more important function for the Hindutva than an actual
investigation into the veracity of it. It feeds into a specter of
dangerous Muslim males prowling for innocent Hindu girls in
order to dishonor them, convert them into Muslims, and produce more children.
Why the Overpopulation?
Why is the Muslim body (at the level of the individual as well as
the collective) overpopulating according to Hindutva narrative?
The explanation brings together all the threats I had discussed
in Chapter 2 with a new element—a vile, virile, hypersexual
Muslim masculinity (a stereotype I term “the Muslim”). The
demographic increase of Muslims is to do with religion, calculations, and sexuality and here distorted representations
flourish—Islam is backward and regressive in its attitude
toward reproduction; the Qur’an exhorts adherents to produce
more children; the Prophet set a personal example; there is
a prohibition on birth control; and most importantly, Islam
allows/encourages Muslim men to have four wives. Producing
more children is also seen as a calculated move to exercise

dominance. The Muslim proclivity for producing children is
seen as a calculated strategy for outnumbering the Hindus
demographically (Baber 2004).
The explanations of “over-fertile” Muslim body are tied in
closely with the question of identity and difference. By reducing
Muslims to nothing but their overarching religious identity, by
denying any agency to individual Muslims in their own fate, and
by bracketing more than a billion Muslims into one single identity, Hindutva, like other fundamentalisms, works with a simple
stereotyped view of the world. The identity of “the Muslim” is
not what he shares with other human beings (his humanity) in
general or with Hindus in India in particular (say, a shared love
of Hindi movies and songs or cricket). It is what marks him as
different from Hindus—his God and prophet, his religion, his
social practices (in case they differ from the Hindus around
him), his moral values, and his physicality (circumcized penis
is held as marking Muslim men as different from Hindu men).
“The Muslim” thus acquires his identity primarily through
these differences and his behavior (supposed high fertility in
this case) is understood as a product of these differences (from
Hindus), which gives him his separate identity. The focus is not
so much on Muslim women, who in any case are reduced to
being passive, baby-producing machines with no say over their
body; it is on men. Muslim men, unlike women, are seen as having a reproductive choice, which they are accused of utilizing
for the conspiracy of uncontrolled population growth.
Presenting Uncontrolled Fertility as a Sign
of Degenerate Islam
The image of a fertile Muslim masculine body follows on
from the image of a rigid, fanatic Muslim psyche/mentality
and is associated with a discourse of Islamic degeneracy. This
degeneracy is presented not as a decline from or a distortion of
Islam, but as a true manifestation of original Islam. Islam for
Hindu nationalist extremists is a degenerate religion from its
inception. The leaflets and pamphlets I am relying upon here
should not be seen as expressions of extremists on the fringe

of otherwise not-so-extremist Hindu nationalism. Almost all
the Bajrang Dal and VHP activists, and many RSS activists,
I conversed with in northern and western India during my
fieldwork derived their views from these easily available and
well-circulated tracts.
Hindutva activists and ideologues often call upon the Muslim
psyche (as if there is a psyche that is common to hundreds of
millions of Muslims in India) to make sense of the world.
While they ascribe tolerance and positive values to “Hindu
sentiments,” the “Muslim psyche” for them is always already
negative (cf. Brosius 2005: 208). Hindutva specializes in speaking in the name of “hurt” Hindu sentiments but never extends
the possibility of sentiments (that could be legitimately hurt)
to Muslims. Krishnaswami (n.d.) details this putative Muslim
psyche as marked by various features: rigidity; intolerance;
in-built fanaticism fostered by mosques, imams, and Friday
prayers; a penchant to always act collectively; duplicity (fooling
outsiders with the notion that Islam is a religion of peace while
knowing fully well that it is a religion of war); and blind devotion to the Qur’an and Prophet Muhammad. In this description, one can sense not only hatred toward followers of Islam,
but also a convoluted admiration of it in some ways, a desire for
emulation, which we will discuss later in the book. For instance,
one can read the mention of fanaticism engendered by Friday
prayers or the ability to act collectively with a common purpose
not as a criticism of fanaticism or collective action (by Muslims)
but as an expression of regret that Hindus lack this. In fact,
Bajrang Dal activists in Nagpur during my fieldwork (January
2006), lamented that Hindus did not have a regular ritual such
as Friday prayers to bring practitioners together.
The image of “overpopulating Muslims” also fits in with the
ideological representation by Hindutva of Islam and its Prophet
as sexually permissive and morally dubious. Hindutva activists
and ideologues often validate their views on sexuality and Islam
by referring to the writings of Anwar Shaikh, a Cardiff-based
businessman who had rejected his Islamic faith and upbringing.
One particular work of his, which goes into the details of sex
and violence, was referred to me frequently by my respondents.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

“If you want to know how perverted Islam is, read Anwar
Shaikh,” was a frequent comment. Available online, Shaikh
(1999) argues that “sex and violence rank as the two pillars of
the Islamic faith . . . which seeks to exploit man’s weakness for
libidinous delights at the expense of feminine rights and dignity.”
Shaikh discusses in detail the conflict between “dominance urge”
(of men) and “feminine charm” (of women) and how Islam is all
about the conquest of the latter by the former.
Shaikh’s writings are very popular with Hindu nationalists
who present it as authoritative proof of Islam’s doctrinal as
well as practical reality. Almost all Hindu nationalism pamphlets and leaflets I read revel in salacious discussions about
the Prophet’s sex life and claim to cite from the Qur’an and
Hadith different ayats and passages to prove Islam’s backwardness. Many of the tracts present themselves not as a polemic
in favor of a positive ideal, but as a factual account of how
everything is wrong with Muslims and how everything wrong
with Muslims flows from the immorality of Islam itself. The
self-contained discourse of Islam’s doctrinal, historical, and
moral degeneracy dispenses with the notion of interpretation
and translation. Hindu nationalism is oblivious to the fact that
there could be alternative translations of the same ayats or that
all texts are open to interpretation, or that if one puts Hinduism
under scrutiny using an ahistorical and selective approach of
the Hindutva kind, it too will come out as hypocritical, sexist,
racist, casteist, and degenerate. For instance, Hindutva writings
are remarkably blind to the celebration of fertility and preference for a son within Hindu religion.
Islam’s degeneracy, according to Hindutva, is reflected best
in its sexual immorality; Hindu nationalists present their own
views, often regressive, on sexuality as moral. In order to elicit
disgust from its readers, a pamphlet (Krishnaswami n.d.)
quotes historical texts to show how Muslim rulers revelled in
plundering India because their religion encouraged them to do
so. “If the breasts are large or vagina wide or baggy (which does
not give requisite pleasure) whether in a virgin or a non-virgin,
the purchaser has a right to return her to the seller and claim
refund for money”—according to Krishnaswami (n.d.: 10), this

was one of the rules provided in Fatawa-i-Alamgiri. Hindutva
writings selectively (mis)quote from a wide range of historical
sources and use their own version to suit their agenda. What
is missing is a critical discussion of the choice of sources and
wider historical context within which such manuals for behavior and conduct may have been written. Also missing is selfreflection. Don’t the Hindus have religiously sanctioned sexual
practices (say that of Devadasis) that are no longer socially
acceptable? Hindutva writings mostly ignore such scrutiny.
The most important thing here is the purpose of citation from
Islamic sources. What is the significance of citing passages
from historical documents written many centuries ago? It is
not to promote historical scholarship, but to validate a certain
Islamophobic political position. An ahistorical or a selective
take on history is used to confirm the contemporary Hindutva
position.
The motif of Rape performs an important function in
Hindu nationalism—it represents a dangerous act indulged in
by inimical Muslims throughout Islam’s history, it represents
the vulnerability of Hindu women, and it represents an always
present security threat to the body as well as honor of individual Hindus and the collective Hindu community. A discourse
of defilement is often deployed to paint Muslim minorities’
relation with the Indian body politic—Muslims have “raped”
or are hell-bent on “raping” India. Amrish Ji (2005), a leader of
a militant organization Bajrang Dal, in a public speech accused
Muslims of treating “Bharat Mata” (“Mother India”) as a
“dayan” (“Witch”), of raping her.
Hindutva ideologues indulge in stories of rape or attempted
rape of Hindu women during Muslim rule, sometimes in
gory detail. For instance, while cataloging what he calls the
historical crime of Muslim rule in India, Sen highlights the
sex-enslavement of Hindu women under Firoz Shah Tughlaq
(1351–1388) in these terms: “According to Tajriyat-ul-Asar,
the abducted Hindu ladies were not just raped, they were
subjected to unparalleled tortures like penetration of female
organs with red hot iron rod, sewing up of vagina and chopping-off of breasts by the Muslim invaders” (2001: 26). This is

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

no gender-sensitive or feminist critique of the use of rape as a
tool of war but a provocative piece to generate disgust among
Hindus. Hindutva ideologues have no concern for women
and sexual violence directed against them. Hindu nationalists
have no interest in the documentation of gender-related violence suffered by all women, including Muslims. For instance,
Hindutva forums largely ignored the news of rape and murder
of two Kashmiri Muslim women in May 2009 even though all
major media outlets covered it—a search on Hindutva Web site,
www.hindujagruti.org, on 20 July 2009 refers only to the rape of
Hindu women at the hands of Muslims or Christians, but not
a single mention of Muslim women as victims. A similar search
on www.sanghparivar.org on 22 July 2009 brought news mostly
of “Hindu women raped” and a few of the “alleged rape story
of a nun.” It presented stories of Hindu women victims as facts
only when the perpetrators belong to minority religions while
ignoring all other cases. Hindutva seeks to bolster the myth of
preying Muslim males. Not a single pamphlet, leaflet, book,
online tract I came across ever mentioned Hindu men as perpetrators of sexual violence. The specter of the Muslim rapist
and Hindu female victim is the only one propagated by Hindu
nationalists. Sexual violence committed by Hindu men is rendered invisible in Hindutva accounts. Rape of a Hindu woman
becomes an attack on the honor of the Hindu community only
if the rapist is a non-Hindu.
Even in the actual rare cases of Muslim rapist/Hindu victim
(e.g., a case of gang rape of a girl in Surat in July 2009 was
discussed by Hindutva sympathizers solely in terms of Muslim
rapists and Hindu victim—see “3 Muslims gang rape” 2009—
even though there is no indication that the religious identity
of the victim or the perpetrators is relevant at all; VHP called
for a strike in the name of avenging Hindu pride, see “Gang
Rape” 2009, while Muslim organizations went out of the way to
demand strict punishment against the rapists, see “Surat gang
rape” 2009), the woman’s individual humanity and pain has
no meaning in the Hindu nationalist worldview; only Hindu
honor matters. This dehumanization of a victim of rape (for
her only role is as yet another Hindu victim of the rapacious

Muslims) is a reminder of opportunist appropriation of narratives of female rape by Hindutva. It is not difficult to see the
salacious undertones of these narratives. Gory descriptions of
sexual violence betray a porno-sexual impulse. This impulse
by its very nature may not always be evident publicly, but can
be experienced during private conversations. With many of
my young male respondents from the Bajrang Dal, stories of
rape were more like a fun story to share. The pleasure derived
from storytelling was more visible when discussing the sexual
degeneracy of Muslims.
Sexualizing “The Muslim”
The “overpopulating Muslim” is linked not only to religion
but also to the virility and irresponsible sexuality of Muslim
men (and the overfertility of Muslim women). This imagined
virility is used to construct an image of Muslim masculinity
that is marked by an uncontrolled and uncontrollable lust and
is hence a danger to Hindu women. As Bacchetta points out,
“The counterpart to the chaste Hindu male is the Muslim male
polygamist or rapist, and to the chaste motherly Hindu woman
is the Muslim woman as prostitute or potential wife” (2004:
101). Asexualizing the Hindu Self (or at least disciplining sexuality) within Hindu nationalism accompanies a pornosexualizing of Muslim men and women. The imagined Muslim male
body, with the female body being merely a passive recipient, is
a repository of various sexual desires/revulsions expressed by
Hindu nationalist activists. The hypersexuality of the Muslims
is seen as common sense within Hindu nationalism. Muslims
are believed to have rampant sex—many jokes, sayings, personal
stories (“I do not know any Muslim myself, but someone I know
knows a Muslim man who . . .”), pornographic tales, and serious
analysis (“why are Muslims more dangerous than Christians?”)
take this sexualization of Muslim men for granted. The motif
of “overbreeding” Muslims is seen as proof of the hypersexuality of the Muslim male body. Jokes about prolific, irresponsible, indiscreet, and immoral sexuality of Muslims proliferate.
Alternative sexual practices (homosexuality) are also imagined

onto the Muslim Other. Muslim hypersexuality is ascribed to
religion, diet, culture, physicality, living pattern, and morality.
Most of the views about Muslim sexuality (see also Kakar 1996)
here have been gleaned from personal conversations and interviews I conducted during my fieldwork in 2005–2006—these
came up in our discussion on the supposed high fertility and
its explanations. Hypersexuality was presented as the obvious
explanation for Muslim overpopulation.
RD (name withheld), a male photographer in his twenties
from a provincial north Indian town and a Hindu nationalist
activist with the VHP, explained to me how he was an expert in
identifying Muslim men just by looking at their eyes since there
was an essential untrustworthiness and (“vehshiyat”/savage)
lust in their eyes (Personal Interview 2005a). In an almost lyrical Hindi, he explained that Muslims engage in rampant open
sex since they are children—“Bachpan mein chuppan chuppai
khelte samay, chudam chudai ho jaati hai” (“While playing hide
and seek during childhood itself, fucking takes place”). A small
admiring crowd consisting of young male activists, a few older
volunteers, and half a dozen policemen gathered around us to
see an awakened Hindu man (RD) enlightening a naïve Hindu
man (myself). Their smiles turned into laughter as RD narrated
a joke about a typical Muslim family—“Ek baap ne apni ladki
ko akele paa kar pakad liya aur kahaa jo mazaa tujhme hai woh
theri maa mein nahin. Ladki ne kahaa, haan bhaiya bhi yah kehte
hain” (“A father, finding his daughter alone, catches her and
says, ‘you give more pleasure than your mother.’ The daughter
replies, ‘yes, elder brother says the same’”). When I suggested
that the common view of Muslim families in India is of sexual
repression as symbolized by Muslim women in burqa/veil and
not hypersexuality, RD brushed it aside as my ignorance. His
repartee played upon the pronunciation of word “burqa”. This
is veil in Urdu and Hindi; but when spoken aloud, it can sound
similar to a pejorative expression for “of cunt” or “cunt’s”—
“kehne ko moohn ka parda, kehlo to bur/qa” (“Supposedly a veil
for the face, can be called of cunt’s”). Incest, sexual permissiveness and indiscretion, perversion—all these are imagined
onto the Muslim bodies. The overwhelming discourse here is

of Muslim degeneracy. Excess is condemned as a vice here but
the manner in which it is narrated implies a pleasure drawn
out of the narration of the excess. Rejection of sexual pleasures
as a sign of immoral excess of Muslims went hand in hand
with unprompted indulgence in describing it. Such pornosexual imagining of Muslims allowed young male activists like
RD to derive pleasure through displacement. In lieu of sexual
excess, which may be difficult in the conservative environment
of the small towns and because of Bajrang Dal activists’ own
inadequacies (while seemingly proud of their Hindu nationalist identity and even bragging about the power and influence
they have, a number of them betrayed anxieties about not
having money or contact to move higher in life and, thereby,
condemned to be looked down upon by big city types), they
indulged in stories and myths. I say myths because when I asked
them about the basis of their “knowledge” about Muslim sexuality, their answer was “We all know,” “everybody knows.” In the
minds of these Bajrang Dal and VHP activists, Muslim virility
was a product of irresponsible sexuality, which in turn was a
cultural condition. Muslim culture is said to be permissive even
when it may seem apparently more conservative. Family, the
bastion of cultural values in the case of Muslims, is invested
with unfamily/immoral practices (incest). The overall picture
is of animality.
PT (name withheld), a young VHP activist in Nagpur in central India, narrated a story to support his claims about Muslim
overpopulation, immorality, hypersexuality, and cultural backwardness (Personal Interview 2006). A police constable on his
routine nightly round in a Muslim area noted a common practice and informed PT that because “there are so many people
in a single household they all cannot sleep together inside the
house; so the young men and old men take turns to go inside
and sleep.” This narration of a supposed observation has a
sexualized connotation too; it hints at young men and old men
having no discretion about who they sleep with when they go
inside. This became clear during my conversation with PT and
half a dozen other male Hindu nationalist activists in the VHP
office. Most explanations about the Muslim threat were filled

with talk about sexual license within Muslim families. I was
informed that “if a Muslim man gives triple talaq [divorce] to
his wife and then regrets it, there is a way out—the woman can
marry someone else and then get a divorce from the second
person and come back to her first husband or more simply
rectify the talaq by sambhog [sex] with another man.” PT had
gained his knowledge about Islamic practice from Swarup’s
booklet. Swarup (n.d.), originally published in 1982, provides
a detailed discussion of marriage and divorce in Islam through
(mis)quotations from the Hadith. The tone is one of salacious
gossip. “One cannot remarry one’s divorced wife unless she
subsequently married someone else and the new husband had
sexual intercourse with her and then divorced her.” Without
going into the veracity of such a quote, I only want to point out
the intention behind the citations. The intention of Hindutva
ideologues is not to understand or analyze Islamic practices but
to present them selectively as illustrations of sexual immorality.
For religious nationalists who may frown upon widow remarriage (except as a regrettable necessity to ensure that Hindu
widowed women do not get preyed upon by Muslims; PT and
his friends in Nagpur gave this as a rationale; for a similar trend
in early twentieth century, see Gupta 2001) or who may find
practice of sati (widow burning on her husband’s pyre) as an
ideal, a religious sanctioning of easy divorce and remarriage is
perceived as immoral.
A policeman, SS (name withheld), I met in Ayodhya as well
as in Hardwar where he was protecting a senior VHP leader
(Personal Interview 2005b), offered his own elaborate rationalization of supposed Muslim hypersexuality in multiple
terms—their nonvegetarian diet (especially beef) increases
body heat; Islam as a religion encourages all forms of immorality; male circumcision or khatna; the public face of the
repressive Muslim culture hides the oversexed practices inside
the homes; and cramped living conditions (ghettoization)
of Muslims in old parts of many cities encouraging closer
physical contacts. SS revelled in attention as I noted down his
hate-filled stereotypes, which he saw as common sense. The
association of beef eating with sexuality came up a number of

times in different towns—beef eating and hypersexuality were
both condemned as signs of cruelty, irresponsibility, animality, and immorality. Ghettoization of Muslims is presented
by Hindu nationalists as a cultural preference (“these people
prefer to live cooped up like animals”) and not an unavoidable response to discriminatory practices in the wider Indian
society. When I asked if SS or other activists standing around
him would mind if a Muslim family moves in as their neighbor, all were united in their resolve not to let Muslims reside
in Hindu localities. I pointed out that if most Hindus share
their attitudes, Muslims will have no option but to be ghettoized, their response was “so what?.” The connection between
their attitude toward neighborhood and the not-so-common
practice of Muslim ghettoization or separate enclaves was lost
on the activists.
SS had also brought a sexual organ into the picture as an
explanation for “the Muslim.” The penis—rather the circumcised
penis—came up a number of times in private conversations
in response to my question as to how do Hindu nationalists
explain the alleged Muslim overfertility. As pointed out earlier, “the Muslim” is imagined as an identity that is based on
everything that is different from the Hindu norm. Body and
physicality militate against an easy distinguishing of Muslims
from Hindus. Sartorial practices may enable one to identify
Hindus from Muslims only if they are wearing what is seen as
traditional outfits. Difference of religion does not mark itself
on the corporeal identities, except in one way. Circumcision
of the penis is not a common practice among Hindus while it
is religiously binding for Muslims. This minor difference gets
blown up in the rhetoric of Hindu nationalists when explaining Muslim sexual politics. SS (Personal Interview 2005b)
argued that circumcision is unnatural and increases the sex
drive of Muslim men. A common slang used for Muslims in
North India was katua (or kattu or katwa, infamously used
by BJP MP Varun Gandhi in an election campaign speech in
2009) referring to one who is circumcised (on stigmatization
of circumcised penis, see Mehta 2000). This reduces a Muslim
male to one of his body organs. The organ that is referred to

pejoratively as abnormal is appropriated as an explanation for
abnormal hypersexuality and abnormal immorality of the person possessing it. It is this abnormality that makes the Muslim a
lurking rapist and a potential threat to Hindu women. But he’s
not only a rapist but also a seducer and hence an even greater
threat to Hindu men. As Giriraj Kishore is quoted as having
said, “There is a physical reason Muslims can seduce Hindu
girls. They give them more sharirik anand (physical pleasure)
because they have a surgery, Hindus don’t” (quoted in Naqvi
2007).
Such a porno-nationalist imagination of the Muslim Other
performs two moves at the same time. It assures the Hindu
nationalist Self of its moral superiority; yet, at the same time,
it instils an anxiety about the threatening masculine Other. As
Tanika Sarkar rightly points out in the context of anti-Muslim
violence in Gujarat in 2002, “There is also the perpetual fear
of a more virile Muslim male body that lures away Hindu girls,
a kind of penis envy and anxiety about emasculation that can
only be overcome by doing violent deeds” (Sarkar 2002). This
fear clearly informed attempts by militant Hindutva organizations in 2005 to prohibit Muslim men from participating in
the Dandiya festival in parts of central India (Indian Express
2005). The anxiety about Muslim male sexuality among
young VHP and Bajrang Dal activists was a strong theme that
emerged out of my ethnographic fieldwork with them. For
instance, PT, the young activist at VHP’s Nagpur office tried to
convince me that “Muslim men are too sexy because they have
hard forehead due to circumcision and this is preferred by
(Hindu) girls” and this is why “we need cultured Hindu girls
who think of their family and not sex” (Personal Interview
2006).
This anxiety threatens to destabilize the Hindu collective
body unless it is awakened to the threats posed by the Other.
Hindu nationalists take the protection of Hindu women, Hindu
family, and Hindu property as their responsibility. Individual
anxieties about the “protection” of Hindu female bodies metamorphose into a collective masculine anxiety about the security

and welfare of the Hindu samaj (society), dharma (religion),
and sabhyata (civilization). Sociocultural organization and
political mobilization are answers to this anxiety. Hindu
nationalism, despite being a majoritarian nationalism, has a
masculinist anxiety to which it claims to provide a solution
through a masculinist-nationalist awakening.

The Unawakened India

H

indu nationalists see themselves as a beleaguered lot
fighting against hostile religious minorities to protect the
Hindu majority and strive for a Hindu Rashtra. Their role is of a
vanguard because the significant bulk of the Hindu population
they claim as their cultural constituency have never voted for
Hindu right-wing political parties. Most Hindus have kept away
from Hindu nationalism politically. Hindutva blames this on
the influence of alien ideologies (secularism, democracy, communism), degenerate foreign ideas (Westernization), political
opportunism (non-Hindutva political parties are rejected as
opportunists who pander to minority and caste vote banks), and
divisive tactics of foreign religionists. According to a Hindutva
ideologue, the “Hindu addict of Macaulayism” (Macaulayism is
used pejoratively to signify deracinated, Westernized Indians,
following on from Thomas Babington Macaulay’s initiative to
anglicize education in India in mid-nineteenth century British
India) refuses to recognize any danger to Hindu society, pities
minorities as downtrodden, assigns to the Hindus “an inescapable moral responsibility to rescue their less privileged brethren
from the plight into which the Hindus have pressed them”; and
harangues Hindus to set their house in order first (Goel n.d.b.).
The unawakened Hindus (i.e., non-Hindutva Hindus) are
sleepwalking into destruction brought about by the religious
minorities and the only solution to this is the culture and politics of Hindutva.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

In this chapter I focus on how Hindutva represents the
majority community of Hindus as vulnerable to seduction
and a victim of minority expansionism. The discussion will
be brief because while Islam (and to some extent Christianity)
elicits fear and disgust among Hindu nationalists (the subject
of this book), “internal” weaknesses afflicting Hindus themselves elicit disappointment and lament. In his defense of the
RSS, Oberoi argues that the origin of the organization in 1925
under Hedgewar can be ascribed to a realization that “real
cause of failure of Hindu society was internal dissension, lack
of self-respect, lack of collective concern about the interest of
the nation as whole” (Oberoi 2001: 3). In fact, one can identify
a significant difference over the public presentation of selective elements of politics of fear. RSS writings and ideologues
focus more on how to organize Hindus as a nation and their
primary rationale is the perennial existence of a distinct Hindu
nation without always mentioning the minorities as enemies.
On the other hand, more openly extremist activists of the VHP
or Bajrang Dal are preoccupied with the representation of hostile forces and mobilization of Hindus as a response and their
primary rationale is not the Hindu nation but the threatened
Hindu nation.
Historical Heroes and Violence
How did a relatively few foreigners manage to conquer and
rule India? Hindu nationalists have a fairly standardized
reply to this question—Hindus were not united. An anonymous Swayamsevak (activist) of the RSS writes that while in
the collective consciousness of Hindus in the past, India had
been “dharma bhoomi, karma bhoomi, punya bhoomi and
moksha bhoomi (“holy land, land of deeds, pure land, land
of deliverance”) par excellence, the most important basis
of national identity, India as our rashtra-bhoomi [national
land]” (A. Swayamsevak 2000: 24–25) had disappeared and this
allowed for few foreign invaders to rule India. While characterizing the centuries of Muslim rule as the “Dark Ages,” some
Hindu nationalists seek to recover self-respect by arguing that

not all Hindus were unconscious. Muslim rulers failed to wipe
out or convert all Hindus because of “their vast population
and stiff resistance to conversion” (A Board of Experts n.d.: 5).
The “stiff resistance to conversion” is bandied around without
giving any evidence of sustained long-term campaigns for religious conversion carried out by Muslim rulers.
Hindutva mythologizes certain historical figures, in a rather
ahistorical manner, and presents them as heroes of the Hindu
nation. The main criteria for being a “hero” is not the promotion of Hindu dharma but the use of violence to fight against
those deemed as enemies of Hindus. This reveals the essential
ethos of the entire Hindu nationalism—national heroes are
those who fight, kill, and get killed in the process of “defending”
Hindu India. Historical figures that preached peace, negotiated living with diversity, experimented with more humane
religious practices, or even promoted Hindu religion without
being antagonistic to Islam do not form part of the Hindu
nationalist iconography. Patriotism is proven through violence.
In a tract produced by the RSS, violent struggle (rather than
accommodation) is emphasized as the source of pride for the
putative Hindu nation: “Continual struggle against alien subjugation by patriotic countrymen was the glorious period of our
history. Had such national consciousness been there with all of
us, this country would never have been subjugated” (Bajpai and
Barthawal 2001: 3).
Hindus: A Divided Nation
Rajendra Das, a fiery sadhu at the VHP’s Dharma Sansad in
Hardwar, said with a flourish to his audience: “Hinduon ka
khoon thoda thanda ho gaya hai” (The blood of Hindus has
cooled down) (Das, 2005). Pacifism is equated with impotence
and lack of vigor and Hindu nationalism is presented as a
militarized/masculinized response. Many Hindus, according
to Hindu nationalists, are vulnerable to defeat from hostile
outsiders because of disunity, “false” ideologies of communism
and secularism, influence of Westernization, and an anti-Hindu
democratic political system. Hindu nationalism bemoans the

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

refusal of Hindus to act as a corporate body. They ascribe this
to “opportunist” politicians who focus on caste interests rather
than on a single Hindu identity. Singhal’s speech at the Hardwar
Dharma Sansad was littered with lament at Hindu weakness
and disunity—“Muslims and Christians rule us because we
vote along caste lines,” and “Our parliament is a supporter of
Pakistan and of foreign businesses” (Singhal 2005).
Hindutva ideologues are not blind to social practices among
Hindus (such as extreme caste-based discrimination) that may
contribute to alienation of the poor and the marginalized thus
making them look for alternatives. Paliwal acknowledges that
some of the problems faced by Hindus arise out of their “own
social, cultural and religious distortions and deteriorations”
(2003: 4) but, and this is a significant but, many more are due
to the effects of “evil designs of cruel foreign invaders and
anti-Hindu rulers who distorted and misinterpreted the Hindu
Dharma Shastras to mislead the Hindus.” While Hinduism
may suffer due to distortions and misinterpretations, the same
charitable attitude is never extended to Islam—Islam is seen as
nothing but a fascistic religion, and thus Islamic fundamentalists are understood as the true face of Islam. The endless divisions and subdivisions among Hindus is ascribed to distortions
that are blamed on outsiders. Hindu nationalists encourage
Hindus to go beyond their caste affiliations and act as unified
Hindus—the negative portrayal of Muslims plays an important role in facilitating intercaste solidarity against a common
enemy. Hindu nationalism has had a complicated relationship
with caste, something that is not the focus here, and will require
an entirely new research project. Let me only mention a couple
of observations I made during my fieldwork.
During my conversations with activists in Ayodhya, when
I sought to raise the issue with a few sadhus who came from
a “backward caste” by saying that Hindutva may be an uppercaste conspiracy to prevent them from seeing through the
injustices of the Hindu caste system, the response was not of
hostility but of evasion. In the case of my respondents at least, a
sense of inferiority had been internalized and their frustration
was successfully transformed into a venomous tirade against

“our common enemy” [Muslims and Christians]. During my
personal session with the head of the Ram Janmabhumi Temple
movement, Nritya Gopal Das (Personal Interview 2005e), an
interesting incident occurred. My name and surname does
not give away the caste I was born into. Assuming that I was
a Non Resident Hindu Indian (a category that is often seen
as a constituency for Hindu nationalism), Das started with a
rehearsed tale of how Hindus and Muslims are brothers and if
only Muslims give away certain mosques, there will be harmony
in India. Upon the advice of a friendly sadhu, I emphasized that
I came from a Brahmin family and Nritya Gopal Das’s tone
changed. He became more friendly and open and lamented
how it is not only Muslims but “neechi jaati ke log” (lower caste
people) who have created all the problems. A mere mention of
“Brahmin” identity opened up many avenues of discussion with
more than half a dozen senior sadhus who work directly with
the VHP. The views they expressed of other castes in whispered
tones was only slightly less pejorative as their views of Muslims
and Christians. It is interesting to note that these private views
on caste do not usually get aired publicly; this is in contrast with
the public expression of private prejudices against Muslims.
The rationale for this selectivity is that Hindu nationalists are
immersed in the project to consolidate a single Hindu identity
and will not want to complicate this by bringing up politically
salient and divisive issues such as the caste-based affirmative
action for marginalized caste groups. The silence over caste
“disunity” also contrasts with the shrill rhetoric against foreign
ideologies affecting Hindus—communism, secularism, and
Westernization.
Alien Ideologies and the Unawakened Hindus
Communism or Marxism as an idea or political philosophy
is not engaged with ideologically by Hindu nationalists. The
Hindu Vivek Kendra (HVK http://www.hvk.org), a “resource
centre for the propagation of Hindutva” based in Mumai, tries
to rectify this (in a short tract published by HVK, Raina argues
for the establishment of high-quality modern scholarship

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

in a non-Marxist framework; Raina n.d.). Most of the time,
communism is rejected as an enemy for its “foreign origin”
and its “anti-Hindu bias.” Goel writes, “A communist cannot help being a traitor to his country and his people” (Goel
n.d.b.). Allusions are made to the fact that the communist
political movement in India derived its ideological inspiration
from outside India and that communist politicians allegedly
received funding from the Soviet Union in the past and from
China nowadays. Communism is seen as anti-Hindu for dividing people along class lines and thus disrupting harmony that
is supposedly a feature of Hindu society. Fostering of class
consciousness and awareness of injustices within communities
threaten the Hindu nationalism idea of an organic Hindu society. Communists are also seen as anti-Hindu because of their
progressive cultural politics. The rhetoric of the rights of the
marginalized raised by the Left is seen as divisive by Hindutva.
Champat Rai dismissed communists as “unke rakta aur beej
videshi hai” (“their blood and seed are foreign”; Personal
Conversation 2005f).
A more lethal affliction of modern Hindus, according to
Hindu nationalism, is secularism. India has become a “Secular
dharamshala” (Pandya 2007) allowing anti-Hindu forces to
flourish. The “disease” of secularism, according to Hindu
extremists, does not affect Muslims and Christians for they
are seen as incapable of being secular. There can be no secular
Muslims or genuine Indian nationalist Muslims for they are
those who stayed back to Islamize the rest of India (Paliwal
2003: 51). This idea that Muslim elite who stayed in India after
1947 did not do so out of love for the country or preference for
secular nationalism but because they wanted to Islamize the
whole of India was repeated to me by different Hindu nationalist activists in many towns of north and west India. For Hindu
nationalism, secular Muslim is an oxymoron. Paliwal argues
that minorities cannot be secular because to be “secular one
has to take decisions according to ones’ own consciousness,
freedom of will, and welfare of the state and their people. But
the religious scriptures of these minorities do not allow their
adherents to do so” (Paliwal 2003: 52). In a narcissistic vein, the

development of various forms of secularism in other parts of
the world is ignored in the Hindu nationalist narratives. More
moderate writers such as Varghese put the onus on minorities
to “confirm” their secularism by expressing gratitude to the
Hindu hosts: “The time has come for the minorities in India
to express their full confidence in the fairness of Hindu society.
Only the minorities can bury communalism in India by reposing their faith in the non-exclusivity of the Hindu religion and
the secular foundations of the Indian Constitution” (in Vasuki
n.d.: 5).
Hindutva adopts a two-fold rhetorical strategy when it comes
to engaging with secular democracy—Genuine Secularism and
No Secularism. The first strand rejects the dominant strand of
secularism as pseudo-secularism and presents itself as genuine secularism and Hindu Rashtra as truly secular (Genuine
Secularism strand). For instance, Rao argues that a “Hindu
State has always functioned as a secular and democratic State”
in Seshadri 1990). Subramaniam Swamy in his Hindus Under
Siege: The Way Out calls for an “enlightened secular democracy
which redresses all historical wrongs done to Hindus” (Swamy
n.d.). The second strategy is to reject secularism as alien, opportunistic, and anti-Hindu and argue for a full Hindu Rashtra
(No Secularism strand). It may be tempting to see these strands
as reflecting a tension within Hindu nationalism, as marking
a distinction between moderate and extremist Hindutva. But
I see this less as a tension and more as a convenient ploy to
“have your cake and eat it too”—attack secularism while claiming to be defending it, reject democratic ideals of equality and
dissent while using democratic processes to acquire power and
authority, reject the ideals of free speech and individual rights
in the name of community cohesion while claiming a right to
espouse hate politics in the public sphere.
One may ponder that from a strictly egalitarian principle the
Genuine Secularism strand has a fair case and that it argues for
equal treatment of all religions, a uniform civil code, and the
withdrawal of the “privileged” status of Jammu and Kashmir
(Article 370 of Indian Constitution grants a special autonomous status to the Muslim-majority state). This is misleading,

for Hindu nationalists are selective in their appropriation of
the discourse of equality, rights, freedom, and democracy.
While marshalling these ideals when denouncing Muslims
or Christians, they are active in taking offense at any statement, act, or creative endeavor they classify as anti-Hindu.
The Genuine Secularism proponents will connive with No
Secularism activists in clamping down on cultural practices
they find threatening (say Hindu-Muslim marriages, women
going to pubs, artists depicting Hindu deities unconventionally, books arguing for a secularist outlook on Hinduism). If
we examine the details of the Genuine Secularism strand, we
see that their demands on the minorities, their prescription of
complete assimilation, will mean an erasure of all differences
and hence imply religious minorities becoming proto-Hindu.
If Muslims start seeing Allah as one of the many gods, this
will imply polytheism. Praveen Togadia, one of the most vocal
Hindu extremist leaders, famous for his opposition to secularism, writes sanctimoniously, “Hindutva is itself secular and all
those born in India ought to be the honest & true Indians. Our
written Constitution guarantees to every Indian citizen, a right
to live in peace with freedom in a Hindu Rashtra” (Foreword in
Bhasin n.d.). If the Hindu nation is indeed secular and democratic, why change the Constitution of India to make India a
Hindu Rashtra? Seshadri, a Hindutva ideologue, has an answer
that appeals to the supposed nonpolitical national character of
the Hindu nation:
The difference [between the modern secular concept of nation
and Hindu nation] is profound indeed as between a living and
a non living body. In short, Hindu Rashtra is essentially cultural
and content, whereas the so called secular concept pertains to
state and is limited to the territorial and political aspects of the
Nation. State is just one of the instruments though a very vital
one created by the nation to serve its material needs. The nation
denotes the whole, while the state only a part. State represents
functions of the body part, while the culture represents those
of the mind and the intellect. It is to denote this whole of our
national entity that the word Hindu is used.
(Seshadri 1990)

However, for most Hindutva extremists, including members
of the VHP and Bajrang Dal, secularism is a challenge they
must confront. “The country is suffering from extremism of
Jihad, terrorism and Church due to secularists . . . Anti India
powers encourage Church and Islamic fundamentalisms in the
name of secularism with the support of Indian government”
(Singhal n.d.: 8–9). Secularism for Hindu nationalism is part
of a conspiracy to undermine the Hindu character of India
by blinding Hindus to serious threats posed by Muslims and
Christians. A pamphleteer exhorts the readers: “After partition
of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have become Islamic fix
deposits but India is a joint current account that can be operated at will. In independent India, the secularism has degenerated into an instrument in the hands of militant Muslims
and Nehruvian establishment to blackmail and harass Hindu
majority” (Krishnaswami n.d.: 4). Unlike the “imperialistic”
religions of Islam and Christianity, those that emerged from
India including Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and so on are
“basically spiritual in nature; and emphasize on humanism,
equality, allround physical, mental, and spiritual development
and economic progress of humanity through self-development
along with blessings of God. Here is no messiah, no middlemen, and no agent to seek God and achieve salvation” (Paliwal
2003: 16). Secularists in India, who argue for equal respect of all
religions, are rejected as self-hating Hindus who fail to recognize the inherent superiority of Hindu Dharma. Singhal, from
the VHP states it bluntly—Secularists are solely responsible for
disasters brought about by materialist and consumerist cultures
(Singhal n.d.: 19–20).
The Hindutva attack on secularism is multipronged. They
reject secularism as alien and anti-Hindu, secularists as opportunists (according to Champat Rai, secularists are “beech-ke
log, na satya mein shraddha, naa satya mein” (“in-between
people, have allegiance to neither truth nor untruth”; Personal
Interview 2005f), and secular nationalism as problematic.
For instance, they disagree with the secularist reading of the
partition of India in 1947 as a product of the British policy
of divide and rule and the fringe religious communalisms.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Goel in his pamphlet blames the interaction of two behavior
patterns for the ills of the Hindu society; according to him,
“Muslim behaviour pattern was characterized by acrimony,
accusations, complaints, demands, denunciations, and street
riots. The [Hindu] National behaviour pattern, on the other
hand, was characterized by acquiescence, assent, cajolery,
concessions, cowardice, self-reproach, and surrender” (Goel
n.d.c). This reading of Indian nationalism damns postindependence India for being anti-Hindu. The ideals of secularism, socialism, democracy, multiethnic nationalisms, unity
in diversity, and so on that the Indian state presents as the
strength of India, are all seen as anti-Hindu by the Hindu
nationalists.
It is interesting to see how Hindutva extremists oppose all
progressive politics while denouncing the Muslims as regressive and backward. Paliwal rejects progressive movements of
Dalits, women, and environmental protection as conspiracies
hatched by the Church to exacerbate Hindu disunity. According
to him, these are “theo-political activities directed by the foreign Missionaries and practically executed on the spot by the
local Indian Christians and cheap labour engaged by the foreign money” (2003: 47). Another example can be found with
VHP leader Ashok Singhal, who writes that an example of how
the secularist Congress government conspires to destroy the
backbone of Hindu society is the new law giving equal right to
daughters to paternal property (Singhal n.d.). Instead of seeing this as a step forward in empowerment of women or even
a validation of Hindus as more modern than other religious
communities in India, Singhal argues that the equal right to
property is a conspiracy of the Congress government to destroy
Hindu families by suffocating them within British-imposed
legal structure and thus make them amenable to attack by the
Church. This is so because “the pure brother-sister bond will
collapse as the awareness of right to property will erode the
sense of duty” (Singhal n.d.: 16–17). This attitude of VHP’s
senior leader serves to reinscribe the boundary of rights and
duties for Hindu women—a good woman is one who is sacrificial and self-effacing for her family.

The discomfort of Hindutva with the discourse of rights as
opposed to duty is symptomatic of majoritarian nationalisms.
A movement speaking in the name of a single nation existing
within a diverse population shifts the locus of rights from the
individual to the collective. It asserts the right of the nation to
dictate how the state should function or how the state should
treat those who might be citizens of the state but not belong to
the nation, the minorities. It leaves only duties for the individuals. In this sense, majoritarian nationalism is by its very nature
illiberal.
Apart from attacking secularists and communists as self-hating
Hindus, Hindu nationalists often criticize a “de-Hinduisation
of public life” (Krishnaswami n.d.: 33) through the influence
of Westernization (some term it Macaulayism). The residue of
Macaulayism (Goel n.d.b.) is a “creeping toxaemia which corrodes the soul of a culture and corrupts a social system in slow
stages”; a denigration of all things Hindu is accompanied by an
extolling of all things Western. Parmananda, a Hindu religious
figure, attacked both the secularists for weakening Hindu society and the media for westernizing innocent Hindu boys and
girls through sexually permissive images. His statement, “apne
bache aur bachiyon ko kutta, kuttiya kyon banana chahte ho?”
(“Why do you want to turn your sons and daughters into dogs
and bitches?”), was met with a loud applause during a public
speech in Hardwar in December 2005 (Parmananda 2005).
Westernization is blamed for anti-Hindu ethos in various
walks of life—media, education, history textbooks, culture, and
so on. Singhal in his pamphlet argues that the Westernization
of electronic and print media, consciously or unconsciously,
is destroying Indian culture. “The shamelessness being served
by various channels is poisoning our families and society.
Once the family starts to disintegrate, we should accept that
the very basis of Hindu society will start cracking” (Singhal
n.d.: 18). The bulk of the media, especially English media,
is criticized as anti-Hindu. Krishnaswami laments that “the
‘obsessive-compulsive’ pseudo-secular behavior of national
media can only be explained in psychopathological terms.
It is indeed neurosis, which blinds them to see the obvious

fact. That the foundation of Indian secularism rests upon the
sands of Gandhian falsehood—‘The Islam is a noble faith’”
(Krishnaswami n.d.: 3). Most commentators in the leaflets
and tracts I have researched point toward the ills brought by
Westernization in general but never criticize Indian business
practices or the professional class that has benefited from
recent liberalization and globalization.
Paliwal draws attention to the role of Christianity in
Westernization. He talks about the Church working along with
“capitalistic colonialism” and of free entry of MNCs in press
and electronic media as “destroying Hindu culture, ancient history and misrepresenting Hindu Dharma” (2003: 49). However,
it is difficult to take this apparent antimaterialism of Hindutva
at its face value. For it does not seek to provide any sustained or
well-thought out assessment of the role of business in a society.
It is easy to reject such lip service to antimaterialism because the
same writers talk about threats to national economy and industries by local environmental activists. For example, Paliwal
accuses the environmentalists of working for the Church’s
agenda of slowing down industrial growth (2003: 47). Most
Hindu nationalists remain pro-business and antiunionized
labor. Hindutva affiliated labor unions often work to create
divisions among workers.
Democracy as an Enemy
For Hindu nationalism, the fear of conspiracy from Islam and
Christianity and the ill-preparedness of Hindus to fight this due
to secularism, materialism, communism, and Westernization is
made worse by India’s political system—democracy. According
to Paliwal, Indian Muslims exploit secular democracy in various ways—in the name of protection of minority rights, they
pressurize the Indian government not to implement a Uniform
Civil Code and they “set-up Muslim pockets as Vote Bank
by purchasing extensive areas of land and property in India
by foreign money” and consolidate it “in the name of Allah
and Islam through Fatwas for political purposes” (Paliwal
2003: 26).

Hindu nationalists have a complicated relationship with
democracy. Many try to present Hindutva as a center-right
democratic movement or as being in favor of majority rule and
hence a genuine democracy. But VHP and Bajrang Dal activists I interviewed and interacted with especially in Ayodhya,
Hardwar, Ahmedabad, and Nagpur were united in their skepticism of democracy. For them democracy privileges those who
are united. Muslims act as a vote bank while Hindus are divided
along caste lines; hence the organized minority (Muslims) and
opportunist secularists (non-Hindutva Hindus) who pamper
them win. “The Hindus, in general, do not appear to possess
a strong political will to vote and support, en masse, only a
pro-Hindu candidate and the political party, during the local,
state and central government elections. Slackness in exercising the right to vote in elections among the well placed, and
middle class Hindus, is also a serious problem” (Paliwal 2003:
12). It is interesting that the anxiety expressed here is not only
of Hindus not voting along religious lines, but of low turnout
from “well placed, and middle class Hindus.” This class is seen
as more prone to Hindu nationalist viewpoint than the poor,
marginalized lower classes.
While calling for the creation of Hindu vote banks, Muslim
voters (i.e., the Muslim vote bank) are presented as possible danger to national security. We saw in Chapter 3 how the
Mughalstan (2007) conspiracy lumps all Muslim voters and
all successful Muslim politicians as threats to security. “Due to
the concentration of the illegal immigrants in certain pockets,
they determine the fate of the election there. Thus, the person
that wins will be chosen not by Indians, but by foreigners. They
can well form significant blocks, whose interest will necessarily
clash with those of the country. One thus sees a major security
threat in the situation” (HVK 1995: 4–5).
Thus, in the Hindu nationalist worldview, democracy fails
the majority community. Suresh Das of Digambar Akhara, in
his speech at the VHP Dharma Sansad in 2005, called family Planning “Hindu virodhi” (anti-Hindu) because he saw it
as a conspiracy aimed at reducing the Hindu population and
enabling a Muslim takeover under democracy (Das 2005b).

Das sees the democratic system of rule of the political majority
as the catalyst for a Muslim-calculated overpopulation. All the
sadhus at the Dharma Sansad shared his skepticism of democracy as a system, with one calling for a shift from Adharma Raj
to Dharma Raj (Irreligious Rule to Religious Rule), where rulers
are bound by the guidance of religious figures.
Conclusion
“Honestly speaking, the bare truth is that in the truncated India
today, the Hindus appear to be unconcerned with the crisis of
their own survival and existence. They are desperate and unorganised. They are socially fragmented, religiously divided and
politically exploited” (Paliwal 2003: 7). Hindutva presents itself
as the cure. Playing a politics of fear—where secular democracy
colludes with the machinations of hostile minorities in keeping
the Hindu nation in disarray—Hindutva calls for an awakening
of the Hindu body politic.

Awakening the Hindu Mind
and the Hindu Body

O Hindu ab to jaag
O Hindu ab to jag, kantha mein laagi phansi!
Kantha mein laagi phansi, thari log udave hansi!!
O Hindu . . .
(O Hindu, now at least, awaken

There is a noose around your neck, people laugh at you!!

n the imagined battle with hostile expansionary foreign
religionists, in contrast to emasculated Westernized Hindus
infected by the alien idea of secularism, Hindu nationalists call
for an awakening of the Hindu mind, body, and body politic. An
awakening that emphasizes paurush/virility. Hindu nationalism
seeks to masculinize the Hindu society. History is interpreted in
terms of a pre-Islamic golden era, Hindu-Muslim antagonism
for the past many centuries, emasculation of the Hindu body
under Muslim rule, and selective masculine heroes who resisted
alien Muslim rule, thus providing an inspiration for contemporary Hindus. Religion is reinterpreted to purge its ambiguity,
diversity, and accommodativeness and to emphasize its martial
and organizing potential. Prakashananda, a 100-year-old religious figure, declared to a crowd in Hardwar in December 2005,

that the day Hindus awaken the universe will shake: “bharat ke
charno par brahmand jhukega” (“the world will bow at the feet
of India”) (Prakashananda 2005).
In this chapter, I chart out the centrality of awakening to the
Hindutva enterprise. The emphasis is on the individual Hindu’s
mind and body as well as on the collective Hindu nation. Fear
of the inimical minorities is sought to be countered by a pride
in the Hindu self, a self that shuns pacifism and proves its virility through persistent individual vigilance and occasional collective violence against minorities. Champat Rai, a senior VHP
leader, explained the rationale for having a militarized Hindu
nation: “Most Muslims in India are converts; they converted
out of fear, greed, or ignorance,” and if Hindus are strong,
most “cowardly” converts will come back to the Hindu fold
(Personal Interview 2005f). Thus, Hindutva’s collective fantasy
of a resurgent Hindu nation embodies violence, pride, and a
strong sense of affirmation. Contemporary Hindu nationalists
imagine a masculinized Hindu society that is reproductively
fertile, effectively organized, proud of its culture, and awakened
to the dangers posed by enemies within the country.
Awakening the Hindu Mind
Though critics often reject Hindutva as a combination of
extremism with obscurantism, Hindu nationalists place a lot of
emphasis on consciousness raising and infusing the society with
Hindutva ideology masking itself as true knowledge. Hindutva
has its own version of “false consciousness,” which is said to
affect secularist Hindus who do not see Muslims and Christians
as enemies. Hindu nationalists involve themselves in generating, among the wider population, a sense of pride in Hindu
nationalist consciousness. As shown in the previous chapters,
this consciousness is intricately linked with being conscious
as well as cautious about the enemies of the Hindus. Paliwal
reminds his readers that “every Hindu should watch carefully
the goings on in their neighbourhood, and complain to the
government against those who are indulging in antinational
activities” (Paliwal 2005).

Hindutva’s ideologues, in public speeches as well as private conversations, in writings (online and offline) as well
as through images, remind Hindus of primarily three things:
first, their cultural identity as Hindu is most important; second, they should be proud of this and act collectively as a
body politic; and third, the Hindu nationalists are the defenders of their cultural identity and political interests against the
combined forces of their enemies. Goel cajoles his readers
that the awakening has to be comprehensive as Hindus should
become
aware of the fundamentals of their own faith (Hindu Spirituality),
the premises on which their own society has evolved (Hindu
Sociology), and the vicissitudes which their own society has
experienced in the march of Time (Hindu History). These are
the three domains in which the Hindu image has been distorted
to the utmost by imperialist thought systems, resulting in a deep
sense of inferiority from which Hindus suffer at present.
(Goel n.d.a)

The primary emphasis of Hindutva is on the mind as its awakening is seen as the first and most crucial step toward the realization of the Hindu nation in India.
Leaflets, pamphlets, books, blogs, and so on are utilized to
spread and consolidate Hindutva’s views. The exhortation to
spread the “truth” around to increase Hindu nationalist awareness is strong. An example can be found in the foreword of a
book by Balraj Madhok, a prominent Hindu nationalist ideologue who has a sparring relationship with the Sangh Parivar
(especially the BJP).
Unfortunately the people of Hindustan i.e. India which has been
the worst victim of this conflict for centuries have remained
ignorant about the root causes of the conflict and motivation
behind Islamic Jehad. This ignorance of the leaders and policy
makers of Hindus have cost the Hindus and Hindustan dear.
The problem is getting worse every day because of the growing
Muslim population. Basic authentic information about Islam
and Muslim problem has been given in this booklet for the

(Madhok 2005)

The awakening of the Hindu mind is thus mostly about accepting
the Hindutva narrative on Hindu India under siege from hostile
minorities and spreading this message around. A person has the
responsibility to not only open her eyes to the truth (the only
truth is the one espoused by Hindutva) but to encourage others
around her to do the same. The best, and most disturbing, example of this is a manual (A Board of Experts n.d.) I managed to
lay my hands on in Ahmedabad’s VHP office. I have summarized
key parts of the manual in Appendix A. “The main purpose of
this training manual is to create a group of non-Muslim experts
on Islamic theology in order to expose Islam to the non-Muslim
masses and demolish the myth of ‘religion of peace’ as Islam is
generally misportrayed by the secularist agents of Islam,” the
book clarifies. This manual clearly destroys the self-serving myth
that Hindutva responds to and merely speaks for the already
existing views of Hindus against the minorities.
It must be zealously remembered and followed for all times
that this “Training Manual” is not meant for the general public.
It is specifically for the people who have resolved to shoulder
the job of exposing Islam as a mission of life. Each copy of this
“Training Manual” has a separate code-number. The activist to
whom a copy of this ‘Training Manual’ is allotted must not part
with his copy. Lending the copy to another person, whoever he
may be, for even a very short period or photocopying the same
is strictly prohibited and any such act shall be considered a serious breach of organizational discipline for which the concerned
activist shall be held liable and answerable. The reader must go
through this “Training Manual” with utmost sincerity and thoroughness and must achieve a complete grip over this subject
before taking it to the public. In each and every session/debate
on this particular subject, activists are instructed to carry a copy
of the Quran for ready reference and demonstration.

Hindutva awakening is actually a concerted attempt to transform the common sense of the Hindus. While claiming to
represent truth about Islam, Hindutva activists are engaged
in fabricating their selective Islamophobic representations as
the truth. Hindutva is thus engaged in propaganda. One of the
instructions provided in this training manual is for the experienced Hindutva activist to confront a secularist in public:
“Remember that though the secularist fellow sitting opposite
you is the focus of the questions, but you should throw these
questions in such a manner [as] if you are asking the same to
the public. Interact with the crowd always to expose and heckle
a secularist” (A Board of Experts n.d.: 85). The clinical and
calculating characteristic of this manual leaves no doubt that
there is nothing spontaneous or natural about Islamophobia
among Hindus; fear of Muslims is a product of labor. The
“Training Manual” is divided into three broad parts. The first
part deals with the “theological Exposition of Islam,” the second
with guidelines on how to counter specific arguments made by
secularists and the Muslim intellectuals about Islam being a
religion of peace. The third part deals with the “Strategy of creating awareness among the non-Muslims regarding the Islamic
danger.”
An important strategy for collective awakening is the control
over language. Hindu nationalists recognize the important role
of language in shaping the perception of reality. Krishnaswami
advises activists to use the following expressions: “Muslim
terrorist” instead of “Kashmiri militant,” “Islam” in place of
“Islamic fundamentalism,” “Hindu victims of ethnic cleansing”
for “Kashmiri migrants,” “Opportunistic Islam” for “moderate Islam,” “Mask-of-Islam” for “Sufi-Islam,” “terrorist rights”
instead of “human rights,” “bastard-harem culture” instead of
“composite culture,” “Agents of Islam” instead of “Leftists and
Communists,” and “Nationalism” instead of “Hindu communalism” (Krishnaswami n.d.: 30–31).
Thus, Hindutva’s mind awakening is aimed at individual as
well as collective “salvation.” The awakening is not about the
development of critical faculties but an acceptance of conformity. A conformist way of thinking that accepts the Hindutva

worldview without questioning. It is also an uncritical celebration of what is presented as an authentic Hindu cultural
identity. The term that is relevant here is jagran—it implies
both an awakening and a worshipping. Hindutva’s effort to
awaken the Hindu nation goes hand in hand with worship
(uncritical celebration) of the Hindu Self.
Let me give another example of how Hindutva seeks to generate Hindu pride through subtle and mundane ways. Rather
than invent new modes of communication, they seek to use
the already existing ones. Culturally embedded modes of transmission of ideas and narratives allow Hindutva to represent
itself as a mere reflection of the Hindu culture, rather than as
an innovation. For example, a Hindutva ideologue exhorts his
readers and followers to use stories to propagate Hindu dignity
(Abhayankar 2001). In a pamphlet produced during Sangh’s
Rashtriya Jagran Abhiyan (National Awakening Campaign) of
2000, there is a Q&A “Did you know” section. Quizzes and
Q&As form a staple of the print media in India, and Hindutva
tracts too make use of these formats. A quick look at some of
the questions and answers illustrates the purpose—it is not
to generate general knowledge but to instil a sense of pride in
Hindu history.
Who discovered America?
Christopher Columbus? No.
There is proof of images of Indian art in the temples of the
Aztecs which prove that the Indians had already been there.
Who discovered India?
Vasco-de-Gama? No.
Vasco-de-Gama’s ship was towed from Africa to South India
by an Indian sailor. The Indian ship was many times bigger than
the ship of Vasco-de-Gama . . .
When was electricity discovered?
About 100 years ago? No.
The Vedas the oldest book in the world, give clear definitions
of electricity, magnetism, heat, light, sound and ether . . .
All the above is just the tip of the iceberg, the list is endless.
But, if you don’t see even a glimpse of that great BHARAT
in the India of today, it clearly means that we are not working

up to our potential and that, if we do, we could once again be
an evershining and inspiring country taking along the world to
great heights.
Let us be confident. If our forefather could do it, why can’t
we, their worthy children?
(RSS 2000b: 16–18)

The above example shows that Hindutva is adept at utilizing
popular modes of knowledge creation and transmission. They
not only appeal to faith, but seek to shape the common sense
of the wider society. It is wrong to see Hindu nationalists as
parochial, nonmodern, and unaware of the globalizing world
around them; they are no “country bumpkins.” Hindutva thinkers always make use of examples from beyond India to validate
themselves. As the above quiz shows, the “knowledge” about
the modern world is very much part of the Hindutva lexicon.
However, this modern worldliness has only one purpose—to
legitimize and validate the superiority of the ancient Indian/
Hindu civilization. Hindutva polemic never looks for validation through Persian, Arabic, or Turkic sources and it conveniently ignores achievements made in India under the Muslim
rulers. The focus is always on using Europe to validate Hindu
civilization. The knowledge of the “international” as well as
“history” services the contemporary politics of reshaping common sense in India.
Awakening the Hindu (A)Sexual Body
As expressions of collective politics, the national cannot function without individual corporeal bodies that perform. The
body is crucial to the nationalist project. Performativity is “not
a singular act; it is a repetition and a ritual, which achieves
desired effects through its naturalization in the context of a
body, understood, in part, as a culturally sustained temporal
duration (Butler 1999: xiv–xv; see also Butler 1993). These
performative and performing bodies in the nation-politics are
predominantly, though not exclusively, male identified bodies, especially when conjured up as active agents. However,

limited scholarship has dealt with the masculinity of the movement, particularly in regard to its personnel, ideas, and ethos
(Bacchetta 1999; Banerjee 2006; Hansen 1996). Hindu nationalism is a gendered nationalism; and even though this gendering has masculine as well as feminine aspects, depending on
the context (for instance, the representation of Mother India),
overwhelmingly, it is gendered masculine (where an awakened
masculine nation is called to protect the feminine land). Hence,
it is not very different from nationalist movements worldwide
(see Anthias and Yuval-Davis 1992; Enloe 1989; Nagel 1998;
Pettman 1996).
A focus on masculine bodies does not imply that feminine
bodies are secondary since no conception of masculine can
exist without a constitutive mirror opposite of the feminine.
Peterson is right when she argues “it is women’s bodies, activities, and knowing that must be included if we are to accurately
understand human life and social relations” (1992: 11). It is
equally important that we reconceptualize political movements of dominance such as nationalism for what they first
and foremost are: construction/expression of masculinized
bodies that assume the biologically “maleness” as the main referent point. We cannot understand nationalism unless we see
it as constituted primarily through, to modify Peterson, men’s
bodies, activities, and knowledge, even while recognizing that
categories of men and women are not biologically but socially
constructed.
The ideal Hindu person for Hindutva combines a vigilant
mind with a strong body. The Shakha system of the RSS is presented as a “process of man making.” As a pamphlet produced
by the Sangh explains, for them man making is the same as
character building (which in turn is a mix of love for the motherland, feeling of brotherhood for the fellow swayam sevaks and
regarding the whole nation as a family) (Bajpai and Barthawal
2001: 9; see also National Movement & the RSS 2000). The use
of motifs of man, motherland, and brotherhood clearly illustrates the idealized Hindutva subject—a masculine figure who
works for the goal of collective Hindu Rashtra.

The RSS, the movement/organization seen as the core of
Hindu nationalism, has an ideal of “saravangee unnati” (“allround development”) that places a premium on “militarylike discipline . . . essential for any nation building exercise”
(Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 2003a) with its stress on physical exercises to mold boys and men. The Hindu body that is to
be (re)masculinized is both individual and collective. Individual
Hindus, through exercises and service, have to become strong
and the collective Hindu nation has to react like a viraat
purush (one corporate masculine body). M. S. Golwalkar, the
second RSS sarsangh chalak (supreme leader), credited with
developing the Sangh as an “ideal ‘Man making’ instrument”
(Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 2003b), saw Hindutva’s mission as that of shaking off emasculating notions instilled by
Westernization/Marxism/Secularism and making “real living
men.” The Hindutva call for an awakening of the Hindu nation
is a project of constructing a militant Hindu masculinity. In
the Madura session of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1940, Savarkar
said: “I want all Hindus to get themselves re-animated and reborn into a martial race (in Sharma 2003: 148).
By setting up contrasts with the dangerously virile Muslim
masculinity as well as with docile Hindu men emasculated by
the feminine principles of Hinduism, the pacifism of figures
like Lord Buddha, the nonviolence of Gandhi, and the dangerous idea of secularism (Agarwal 1995: 37–38), Hindutva
presents itself as creating/awakening a different masculinity. One that is virile and masculine (in contrast to secularist
Hindus) and yet responsible and controlled (in contrast to
Muslims) (see Bacchetta 2004). The preoccupation with recuperating masculinity, tolerating no more, showing who the
real man is—these characterize the writings and speeches of
Hindutva leaders as well as everyday language of Hindutva
workers (see Patwardhan 1994; Banerjee 2006; Sharma 2004).
No one is spared as the iconography of favorite gods and historical figures (Shivaji and Rana Pratap) undergo militant and
homoerotic makeover with stress on bulging muscles, war-like
expression, and erect demeanor. Lord Rama’s Rambo-esque

imagery (see Kapur 1993), replete with bulging muscle, used
in many Hindutva posters stands in contrast to a more familiar
image of him as soft (see Mishra 2002).
The bulk of Hindus are meant to be reproductively fertile
and produce an increasing number of sons. “We will become
Pakistan unless we organize,” thundered Ashok Singhal in
Hardwar (2005) reminding his audience of the dangers of family planning. According to him, as with most Hindu nationalists, it is only naive Hindus who adhere to the norm of family
planning while minorities breed uncontrollably. The general
Hindu population is encouraged to fulfil their duty to the
Hindu nation by “competing” with overpopulating Muslims.
Suresh Das screamed over the loud applause from his audience:
“Each Hindu bhai [brother] should have at least 6 sons, two for
the service of religion, two for protecting borders and two for
the economy” (Das 2005b). No one asked him about the future
of his ideal Hindu society if only sons, and not daughters, are
born. Singhal’s vision is clear: since Muslims will be 50 percent
of the population because they have a conspiracy of “bacche
badhakar lenge Hindustan” (“we’ll take over India by increasing
children”), Hindus must end family planning and the religious
figures must give the blessing of “Doodho nahaon, pooto phalo”
(“Bathe in prosperity, have plenty of children”) to all Hindus
(Singhal 2005).
Clearly Hindutva is not a reproductively suicidal movement,
but it has the ideal of asexual virility for the committed leaders
and activists. The awakening of the Hindu nation requires sacrifices from at least some of the awakened Hindu male bodies.
A sacrifice not of their masculinity but of their sexuality, and
this sacrifice is deemed to be essential to the performance of that
masculinity. This challenges Connell’s emphasis on sexuality
within hegemonic masculinity, including the argument that “the
most symbolically important distinction between masculinities
is in terms of sexuality. Hegemonic masculinity is emphatically
heterosexual, homosexual masculinities are subordinated . . .”
(2000: 102). While remaining convincingly heterosexual, Hindu
nationalism extols chastity over sexuality and control over
performance. Thus, the hegemonic masculinity within Hindu

nationalist imagination is not simply sexual, but ranges between
asexuality and controlled (hetero)sexuality. “The RSS degrades
sexuality . . . but does not expel them from the discourse altogether. Instead, it projects sexuality onto its Others” (Bacchetta
2004: 101). To be masculine is to perform heterosexual sex;
yet, the ideal Hindu masculinity does not perform or offer a
controlled performance. It does so by denigrating sexuality and
sexual acts as demeaning, distracting, and weakening. The real
men are those that control and/or transcend these bodily weaknesses. The activist in the RSS is “enjoined to be a brahmachari; a
self-less, celibate disciple whose devotion to the common good is
in direct proportion of his self-control” (Alter 1994: 568). Thus,
the ideal Hindu nationalist masculinity does not lend itself to
an easy analysis in terms of virile heterosexuality, for the ideal
masculinity is virile asexuality for the activists and controlled
sexuality for the general population. Therefore, sex is not for
pleasure but a means of producing Hindu children to proliferate
the Hindu population (see Bacchetta 1999). Most Hindu nationalist senior leaders remain unmarried and celibate in the name
of total devotion to the motherland. Like religious ascetics, they
see marriage as a distraction from the higher goals of life; but
unlike them, the Hindu nationalists’ goal is not religious but a
nationalist salvation.
Nationalism is conceptualized as an awakening of the Hindu
nation, which is seen as being made possible by awakening
the Hindu body, particularly the Hindu male body. As Dr
Rameshwar Das Vaishnav Das, a Hindu nationalist religious
figure, proclaimed in a public speech in Hardwar in December
2005, “so long as we have potent (punsat) men, we will win the
oncoming war against the Muslims and their allies” (Vaishnav
Das 2005). These potent men are the ones who can protect
Hindu female bodies, the Hindu nation, and mother India.
But this potent masculinity demands an awakened mind and
an awakened body. In this context, the emphasis on physical
exercises, outdoor sports, and quasi-military drills are meant
to make the Hindu male body physically strong. Brute physical
strength is accompanied by an awakening of the mind, a mind
that is able to recognize the enemies of the nation and is proud

of Hindu history and culture. The concept of shakti (strength)
combines physical ability and mental fortitude. What makes
these men potent is not their ability to perform sexually as an
individual body, but their willingness to sacrifice their individual desires to serve the higher cause of the collective Hindu
body. The RSS, as Hansen argues, serves to “encourage a systematic sublimation of sexual energy into ideologically purified
services to the Mother—the nation” (1996: 148).
While Hindutva is predominantly about masculinizing the
nation and nationalizing masculinity, the role of women is
very important in the movement. A conspicuous feature of
Hindu nationalism, when it rose to political prominence in the
1990s, was the visibility of women as active participants; and
several studies have analyzed the relationship between women
and the movement (Bacchetta 2004; Basu 1996; Butalia 1995;
Jayawardena and De Alwis 1998; Kumar 2006; Menon 2010;
Sarkar and Butalia 1995). Since my research focused predominantly on the production of nationalist-masculinism and its
politics of fear, I do not have much to add to the existing scholarship on women and Hindutva.
Hindu nationalists are not blind to the gender-based inequalities in India. Unsurprisingly, they blame it all on the foreign
influences. As a pamphlet of the most prominent Hindutva
women’s organization, the Rashtra Sevika Samiti, makes it
clear: “Due to constant foreign invasions by Muslims and
later on by British Colonial rule, Hindu traditions were seriously affected and the status of women undermined” (Rashtra
Sevika Samiti 1999: 1). Once all the ills of contemporary Hindu
society are ascribed to the foreign ruler and “foreign religionists,” Hindutva writers and activists wax eloquently about the
idealized position of women in Hinduism. The emphasis is on
woman as a mother figure. The Sangh, an exclusive bastion of
men (Samiti is affiliated to the Sangh family, but women cannot
join the RSS), reminds people that:
Giving utmost respect to womanhood is one of the most
important values of the Hindu way of life. Woman is not
regarded as an object of mere sexual pleasure but as a divine

cultural treasure. It is an integral part of the Hindu way of
life to treat every woman, except one’s wife, that too only in
regard to her role as a wife, as equal to one’s own mother. Every
woman including girl child is to be regarded as incarnation
of motherhood. This value has been evolved and preserved as
the most powerful antidote to the basic male tendency to look
for a chance to assault women . . . Every Hindu attaches great
importance to motherhood and has deep respect for Swa-mata
(one’s own mother), Stree-mata (woman as mother), Bhu-mata
(mother-earth) and Bharatmata (in case of those whose motherland is different from Bharat, their respective country). It is
for this reason that a Hindu, whichever country happens to be
his motherland, remains loyal to that country. This is a special
quality or attribute of the Hindu way of life.
(RSS 2000b: 5, 7)

Purportedly about the role of women in Hindu society, the RSS
tract makes it clear who the primary audience is—the Hindu
male (see also RSS 2000a). It is the male who has the nationalist agency, who is supposedly a respecter of his mother, women,
earth, and mother-nation. The Hindu way of life is seen as
an “antidote to the basic male tendency to look for a chance
to assault women” (one wonders what is the source of this
understanding of male behavior). This allows the RSS and its
affiliates to brush off all incidents of brutalization of women in
India as resulting from non-Hindus or non-Hindu influences.
A Christian or Muslim male rapist is seen as reflecting his religious values, but a Hindu male rapist is seen as having failed
to imbibe the “Hindu way of life.” The homosocial bonding
that characterizes the lives of Hindutva male activists prevents
a meaningful engagement with women as active agents of politics. During my ethnographic field trip, all the activists I met
repeated the idealized polemic of Hindu women as mothers/
sisters/daughters, while reserving sexualization for Muslim,
Christian, and Westernized Hindu women.
In contrast, my limited interaction with women activists—
except for a few sadhvis (Hindu female ascetics) in Hardwar, the
only ones I met were Sevika Samiti and Durga Vahini activists
in Nagpur—gave a different and more diverse understanding of

the role of Hindu women in the Hindu nation. My identity as a
male was an obstacle here and prevented me from establishing
a rapport. The emphasis for Hindutva female activists was on
performing various duties to strengthen the Hindu nation. They
focused on empowerment, on nari shakti (women’s power), at
least in their rhetoric. Unlike the Sangh men who give a more
paternalistic and patronizing view of the Samiti (in private, the
VHP and Bajrang Dal activists in the Nagpur office during my
visit in 2005 laughed off female activists as only good for bringing in tea), women themselves appropriate a more equal role.
In the official biography of Mausiji, the founder of the Rashtra
Sevika Samiti, her relationship with the RSS founder Keshava
Baliram Hedgewar is narrated thus: “Dr Hedgewar became
an elder brother, guide and philosopher for Lakshmi. She also
gave a new direction and a larger dimension to Dr Hedgewar’s
philosophy. She made him realise the significance of the dormant woman power and how essential it was to evoke and
channelise it for the national and social welfare” (Rai 1996: 25).
Clearly Hindutva women see their role as more than that of a
nurturer and carer. A widely available Sevika Samiti pamphlet
“Empowerment Pragmatic” celebrates historical women figures
as “able administrator, a statesman leader and an ideal mother”
(Rashtra Sevika Samiti n.d.).
Yet, the differences over the role of women in Hindu society
are not fundamental. Hindutva men and women agree on the
primacy of the patriarchal family. Any agency that a woman has
is subsumed to that of the family and the ideal family is one that
has a clear division of labor and authority between husband and
wife. Sevika Samiti emphasizes on “Mother Power” and “Mother
Consciousness” and rejects the mainstream women’s movement
in India for “destroying the family setup instead of destroying the
evil conventions” (Rashtra Sevika Samiti 1999: 8). While extolling historical female figures for their leadership, most activities
of Hindutva women’s organizations are geared toward making
girls and women subsidiary to the male figures in their lives (for
example in Ritambhara n.d.). Any leadership aspiration has to
be fulfilled only with the permission of the patriarch (father
or brother or husband). As Sehgal shows through her research,

empowerment of women by Hindutva to counteract the supposed historic victimization by Muslim men ends up reaffirming
feminine vulnerable identity (2007). The empowerment thus has
to be domesticated and nonthreatening to the patriarchal values
of the society. Sadhvi Ritambhara has this to say:
I cannot preach women to struggle with men. There is no question of fighting with men. Our place is higher than that of men.
If you find womanly satisfaction [stri sukh] in competing with
men, you have my permission; but remember that the struggle
and competition will only bring you grief.... The satisfaction
you will get when you give birth to a son, hug him close, and
raise him nicely, feed your loved one, can not be derived when
you salute others [work for others] . . . Motherhood and maternity is your essence.
(Ritambhara 2003: 17–18)

This Hinduized version of women’s empowerment idealizes
family and refuses to challenge patriarchal values and the gender
inequities that flow from it. Hindutva women, as well as men, are
thus the “awakened” Hindus who give up their individual interests for the bigger goal of awakening the Hindu body politic.
This giving up of individual interests for the collective is not a
progressive move to struggle for rights and justice. It is a conservative reaction to social changes that are seen as negative and as
resulting from anti-Hindu conspiracies of minorities. “A Hindu
identifies himself with the glory, the insult and the calamities
of Bharat and responds to it in a very spontaneous manner
disregarding his personal interests. Awakening these sentiments
and organising the Hindus on a cultural basis through women
for universal peace and happiness is the life-mission of Samiti”
(Rashtra Sevika Samiti 1999: 17). Hindutva’s awakening of the
individual bodies thus is aimed at the awakening of the Hindu
collective, the resurgence of the Hindu nation.
Awakening of Culture
Dharma Sansads (Religious Parliaments) are gatherings of
Hindu saints and religious figures under the aegis of the VHP

and are meant to discuss the main issues affecting the Hindu
religion and then agree on resolutions to give guidance to
the activists of the VHP. I witnessed one in the north Indian
pilgrimage town of Hardwar on 13–14 December 2005. The
event started with a sadhu leading a collective song: “Humko
apne Bharat ki mati se anupam pyaar hai . . . har Hindu ka rom
rom Bharat kapehredar hai” (“We have unparalleled love for the
soil of Bharat, each breath of every Hindu is Bharat’s guard”)
preceded and followed by loud chants of “Jai Shri Ram” (“Hail
Lord Ram”). Sadhus would close their palms, raise both hands,
and shout their approval to resolutions being discussed in
Parliament through the chants of Om. The emphasis was on
using songs and kirtans and chants and cajoling the audience of
sadhus to join. Repetition in different pitches and with different
word arrangements was an effective tool. There was a display
of symbolic supremacy of sadhus and sants (holy person) with
VHP leaders being mere lay disciples. Even Ashok Singhal and
Praveen Togadia, two senior-most VHP leaders, touched the
feet of senior sadhus and all the sadhus were garlanded by lay
activists.
As it became evident during the Dharma Sansad, religiousculture is the primordial essence of human life in Hindutva
thinking. Culture is seen as the realm of organic life, as everything good about human collectivity, as heritage, as the common
bond. Sabhyata (civilization) and sanskriti (culture/heritage)
are what make people distinct. However, it is a specific religioninfused and religion-determined take on culture. The Hindu
nationalist worldview on subjects of local life, national politics,
and international relations are suffused with a religious-cultural
framework with the focus on three norms and an aberration—
the clever and expansionary Christian way of life, the violent
and expansionary Muslim way of life, the peaceful and inward
looking Hindu way of life, and the alien and alienating Chinese
communist way of life. It is a putative “Hindu culture,” deriving from thousands of years of history, which is seen as the sole
determinant of Indianness. Indian = Hindu is beyond the realm
of questioning. Thus, here we see the imagination of an identifiable Hindu culture through two processes—a historicization

of contemporary Hindu culture (what is done today has been
going on since time immemorial) and a homogenization of it
(worship of certain gods, say Ram or Hanuman, is promoted
as the essence of Hindu culture). It is Hindu Dharma, which
determines the sabhyata and sanskriti in India and, therefore, the
onus is on the Hindu samaj (society/community) to recognize
this self-identity, promote and protect it.
Democratic politics is seen as a betrayal of culture. In the
Hindu nationalist imagination, culture is good, democratic
politics is bad. Hindu nationalists equate politics with elections.
They argue that the compulsions of democratic politics, the divisions and lack of awareness within the Hindu society of its own
cultural supremacy, the legacy of Gandhi and Nehru in terms
of betraying Hindus and promoting “pseudo-secularism,” and
assertive and conniving enemies within (Muslim, Christians,
secularists, communists, Westernized media) have all contributed to the lack of confidence of Hindus in their own culture.
Politics is corrupt. Parmananda, a sadhu, during the Dharma
Sansad speech, used an analogy of dowry to explain the behavior and greed of politicians.
In a eight daughter family, the father offered the hand of his
youngest daughter of 18 years with a dowry of 1 lakh, his
second youngest with a dowry of 2 lakhs, and so on with the
eldest daughter available for marriage with a dowry of 8 lakhs.
Power hungry politicians are like a man who goes and marries
the eldest daughter due to his greed and thus misses out on the
youngest and hence most desirable daughter.
(Parmananda 2005)

The audience laughed at this. This sadhu’s advice was not to
be greedy but to marry the youngest daughter. His assumption
accepted by the approving audience was that dowry is natural
and it is the youngest, who by virtue of her lower age, is the
most desirable.
Hindu nationalists indulge in politics, but present it as a
regrettable necessity of political mobilization to defend the culture. While most commentators argue that Hindu nationalists

mobilize cultural resources for political purposes, the selfunderstanding of Hindu nationalism is very different. They
have to participate in politics because that is the only way to
defend the Hindu sanskriti, sabhyata, and samaj—the Hindu
cultural body. So, a Hindu body politic is demanded to defend
the Hindu cultural politic. Hindu nationalists, therefore, present themselves as reluctant political crusaders. But they highlight that anything else will destroy the Hindu community. So,
as a “reaction” to the democratic compulsion, they are willing
to play the game of vote bank while at the same time claiming
that their goal is above politics—it is cultural. Praveen Togadia,
the VHP political leader, cajoled the participating sadhus at
Dharma Sansad to politicize their discharge of religious services
to the lay population: “get disciples to pledge to vote as Hindus”
(Togadia 2005).
Hindutva focuses on an awakening of the culture. In order
to put into practice their desire for political mobilization for
the larger purpose of defending and securing the Hinduness
of Indian culture, Hindu nationalism demands an awakening
of culture and those who share the culture. While the Hindu
nationalists reserve their venom for the numerous enemies
of Hindu society, especially the Muslims, their lament and
frustration are often directed against the unawakened Hindu
cultural self. The focus of the VHP is very much on defending Hindus against the alien influences of Islam, Christianity,
Westernization, communism, and secularism. In the West,
where the VHP is active in the diaspora, the focus is on giving an affirmative sense of coherent identity and recognition
to Hindus, though the subtext of antipathy of what is seen as
alien influences remain. For the VHP, Hindus have been lulled
into sleep as a collective body through centuries of enslavement
and foreign rule engendering a sense of inferiority and through
active conspiracies of Muslims and Christians in connivance
with the corruption of secular democracy. And therefore, the
Hindu nationalists’ main task is to awaken the Hindu society
that is proud of its culture and willing to act as a body politic.
As Jagadish Nand roared during the Dharma Sansad, “Agar
hum khare ho jayein, musalman bhi thande ho jayenge, atankwad

bhi khatma ho jayega” (“If we stand, Muslims will cower in fear
and terrorism will be over”) (Nand 2005).
A disciplining of culture is demanded. A sadhu at the
Dharma Sansad, Hans Das of Hardwar’s Jagannath Math,
encouraged his fellow sadhus to use festivals selectively to
mobilize Hindus: “Use Shri Ram Mahotsava during Ram
Navami to distribute saffron flags to ordinary Hindu families,
take pledge from them to vote as Hindu vote bank and create
Hindu Rashtra; mobilize all Hindus including the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled tribes and emphasize all Hindus are one;
rejuvenate akharas [gyms] to tackle the conspiracy of making
Hindu youths lazy and addicted; and create temples as centres
of social and religious consciousness” (Das H. 2005). Political
mobilization is achieved through a single-minded devotion to
a homogenized and historicized Hindu culture. The reality of
the fissiparous, complicated, and contradictory character of
“Hindu” as well as “culture” is seen as an obstacle to overcome.
Discipline the activists, discipline the society, and discipline the
Hindu culture itself in order to make it amenable as a mobilizable resource. And this purging or ignoring of “inconvenient”
plurality of Hindu culture is indulged in zealously.
Transforming culture and making it subservient to the goal
of political mobilization for a Hindu nation thus becomes
acceptable (see also Bhatt 2004; Bilimoria 1996; Bock 1997).
Disciplining requires the censoring and purging of culture’s
plurality and transforming the culture itself. Since what can
pass off as Hindu culture is extremely diverse and plural, Hindu
nationalists seek to transform it to make it more manageable.
A contradiction between the idea of culture as affirmative, unifying, holistic, above politics, and demanding policing and the
actual practice of instrumentalist and selective appropriation
of culture for political mobilization is an important dynamic
within Hindu nationalism. Hindutva organizations tend to
present themselves as organic expressions of an ancient culture
even though a close look reveals the creative ways in which they
transform fuzzy religious and cultural practices (see Katju 2003
on VHP and culture). Gyananda, at the Dharma Sansad, introduced the resolution to declare the Gita as a national scripture

because “it is compact, has great depth, has a wide appeal, was
recognized as superior by Emerson, Carlyle and even Warren
Hastings, and emphasizes duty at a time when everyone talks of
rights; Gita is good even for chandalas [outcastes] as they can
achieve behavioural equality” (Gyananda 2005).
Kalash, an auspicious pot of water, is a common presence
in Hindu religious-culture and part of many private and public rituals. In a short booklet on symbols of Hindu culture
published by the Rashtra Sevika Samiti, Symbols of Bhartiya
Sanskriti, Hindu and Indian (Bharatiya) are seen as one
and the same. The Hindu nationalist subtext becomes clear
when the discussion on Kalash ends with the statement, “The
Kalash of the temple gives us a message that we have to live
a purposeful life by filling it with patriotism, self-respect and
sanctity” (Symbols n.d.: 21, emphasis added). That patriotism
is necessarily about confining one’s locus of passion and affection to a specific bounded community, something that has
no religious validity in Hinduism, is conveniently ignored by
Hindutva.
If the Hindu nationalist vision ever becomes successful, there
will be a clarity, a lack of ambiguity, a Hindu culture devoid
of any “alien” influence, and slightly less than a billion Hindus
marching to the same tune. Even if this requires going against
aspects of Hindu religion, so be it. Transformation of culture is
an essential part of making it amenable to then being used as a
resource for political mobilization, which in turn is justified in
the name of the higher goal of defending the already existing
Hindu culture. So, to protect culture, we need politics; to make
politics work, we use culture; to use culture for politics, we must
discipline and transform culture. Thus, in the name of defending Hindu culture, Hindu nationalists discipline and transform
it, with the ultimate aim of awakening/creating a Hindu body
politic.
Awakening the Body Politic
Awareness is the first step in fighting the war for Hindutva. For
the “strength of the Muslim world lies in the non-Muslims’

ignorance of the Islamic scriptures and doctrines” (Sen 2001: 2).
Consciousness raising, the shaping of common sense, interventions in culture, transformation of religion, masculinization
of nationalism, and other strategies to counter the putative
dangers faced by the Hindus are all aimed at the construction
of a Hindu nation. The fashioning of this Hindu body politic
along Hindutva lines is presented as an awakening of the already
existing Hindu nation. As scholarly writings have argued, this
is how the discourse of modern nationalism functions—by
historicizing the present through a selective use of the stories
of the past.
The autobiography of the RSS, the key Hindutva organization, goes like this—Keshav Baliram Hedgewar founded the
RSS in 1925 after assessing the decline of Hindu unity despite
the “intrinsic strength of Hindu philosophy [of oneness].” He
realized the need to create a force in the society to re-awaken
the Hindus. As Bhiku Ramchandra, a senior RSS official says,
for Hedgewar it was necessary “to instill in the mind of every
Hindu the awareness that Hindu Society with all its faults and
virtues was HIS SOCIETY and his progress was inseparable
from the Society’s progress. In order to create this awareness, he
set about the task of creating an organization of selfless workers dedicated solely to extending this philosophy to all spheres
of national life” (Dada Idate 1997: 2). Thus, from the very
beginning the role of Hindutva organizations was to organize.
It was held that for various reasons including the experience
of foreign rule and the continuing conspiracies of minorities,
the otherwise great Hindu nation had fallen into ignorance
and disunity. The role of the RSS, and subsequently its affiliate
bodies, was to organize Hindus politically.
The constant emphasis in Hindutva writings is on unity and
“organized strength.” Unlike the mainstream Indian nationalism that adopts the ideology of “unity in diversity,” Hindutva
sees diversity as a danger and valorizes unity. “VHP is incessantly working toward awakening the Hindu society, hitherto
divided into several groups under the slogan of Unity in
Diversity, into a fraternal bond with a feeling that all are different parts of a single Hindu body” (Togadia in VHP 2003).

The VHP and other Hindu nationalist outfits are following the
framework originally set by the RSS. In Hegdewar’s opinion,
“An organisation is bound emotionally and cemented by discipline, a sense of belonging and commitment to social welfare. It
is like a rock, solid and strong, because its particles are strongly
coalesced. It is not easy to break it even with hammer” (Bajpai
and Barthawal 2001: 4). RSS and other Hindu nationalist bodies set out to organize and mobilize Hindus in accordance with
their vision. The fact that they have not yet managed to secure
support from majority of the Hindus does not imply that they
are rethinking their vision. Hindutva leaders and activists often
talk about strategies to create a “Hindu vote bank.” Hindu
nationalists modify and adapt their strategies depending on
the situation but their vision of a politicized and organized
community of Hindus—the Hindu nation—remains static.
“The primary task of Vishwa Hindu Parishad is to remove the
divisions on accounts of state, language, sect, caste, hierarchy,
place or region, and create a society that is harmonious, strong
and firm, one whose development is not a hurdle in the welfare
and peace of the rest of the world” (Togadia in VHP 2003: 6).
Plurality and contradictions, historically and socially the essential features of Hindu religion and culture, are thus the main
obstacles for Hindutva. Hindu nationalists, while paying lip
service to tolerance and harmony, have only one aim—to create a corporate Hindu national identity that papers over all the
internal fissures by focusing on the dangers posed by Muslims
and other minorities.
The field of democratic politics is denigrated as essentially
corrupt; hence, large sections of the Hindu nationalist movement, especially the RSS, define themselves as apolitical. At
the same time, Hindu nationalism is essentially a political
movement that seeks to organize Hindu society under its banner; and in this democratic politics, it is seen as an inescapable
evil/ally. While the state is criticized as pseudo-secular and the
generic politician is branded as corrupt, state institutions of
police and military are hailed as potential allies. The capture
of the state—the phallus par excellence—remains an unspoken but clearly evident goal of Hindu nationalists. Praveen

Togadia warned religious men gathered for a public event
in Hardwar in December 2005 against disillusionment with
politics, “disenchantment with politics will not help because
without Raja [political ruler], dharma will perish” (Togadia
2005).
Violence
Violence becomes an integral part of the porno-nationalist
asexualized masculinizing project that is Hindu nationalism.
Violence against inimical Others, especially the Muslims, is
justified and occasionally demanded as an unavoidable reaction. As Chandra argues, stereotypes enable many Hindus, “in
the face of their undisputed implication in savage violence,
to feel varying degrees of guilt and yet to transfer it on to the
ever obliging Muslim aggressor” (1996: 89). My Hindutva
respondents often repeated the saying, “Bhay bin hot na preet”
(“there is no love without fear”). They argued that Muslims
only understand the language of violence. Suraj Pratap Singh, a
Hindu nationalist leader, in a public speech narrated a story of
a man with four sons who were a lawyer, a doctor, a policeman,
and a judge. When someone slaps the father, the sons deliberate
and discuss but take no action. The father laments; he wishes
he had an illiterate son who would take action and avenge him.
Singh cajoles the Hindu men to show their masculinity and to
the accompaniment of loud claps, declares, “If your blood does
not boil now, when will it boil? Slap those who humiliate you,
there is no need to discuss” (Singh 2005). The Hindu nationalist
violence is justified as reducing violence. Thus, for the Hindu
nationalists, all violence perpetrated by them is legitimate reaction to originary provocation and/or violence by the religious
minorities. Responding to the charges and well-documented
attacks by Hindu zealots on Christian missionaries, a Hindutva
pamphlet argues:
There is no programme of any Hindu organisations to attack
missionaries, either singly or on a concerted basis. It is not part
of the Hindu cultural values to indulge in violence. At the same

time, Hindus have to protect themselves, at the physical and
civilisational levels. If the Christian missionaries are creating
harm to them, then the Hindus have every right to defend
themselves. All legal methods will be first employed. If the missionaries persist in their efforts of creating tensions, then some
sort of reaction will always take place.
(HVK 1999: 24)

As I elaborated in the previous chapters, the will to organize
Hindus politically is seen as a response to the threats posed by
minorities. Hindutva claims to desire peace, but it is a peace
that comes from a concentration of power and authority in religious culture–based politicized and militarized communities.
For the Sangh,
To be weak is a great sin. If no society is weak, this world will be
peaceful . . . [RSS] would put an end to the unjust and aggressive tendencies of others. So far, our weakness has encouraged
others to tyrannize us. To ensure that nobody has the courage
to attack us, we want to make this organisation strong. This
organisation will act as a prophylactic to prevent the epidemic
of aggression. If other societies do not attack us, our strength
will pose no threat to them . . . Thus, the aim of the Sangh is
to make an effective organisation of Hindus (i.e. all those who
consider Bharat as their motherland, fatherland and sacred
land) for the protection of its Dharma, society and culture.
This will help us salvage our self-confidence, and looking at our
prowess, the vicious nature of the aggressors will weaken and
they shall never dare to attack us again.
(in Bajpai and Barthawal 2001: 4–5)

Thus, the militarized and masculinized Hindus, led by Hindu
nationalist organizations such as the RSS, are seen as an inevitable and unavoidable reaction to the dangerous forces of foreign
religionists. Hindutva is not only for protection of the Hindus
but also for providing a sense of confidence and pride. The affirmation of the Hindu Self is predicated upon the denigration and
demonization of the Muslim-Christian-Communist-Secular
Other. As a VHP tract clarifies the role for its youth wing, the

the vanguard, to be masculinist-nationalist. They are to transform the entire Hindu society in their image. Until that transformation is complete, their project will continue.

The Awakened Hindu India—
Ayodhya and Gujarat

T

he destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya on
December 6, 1992, and the anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat
in 2002 are two spectacular events that have been etched into
the memory of Hindu nationalists as symbols of the awakened
Hindu nation. These are held out as the prime illustrations of
the Hindu nationalist awakening. The events are sources of
pride because they represent concrete proof that Hindus can
“react” against the danger posed by minorities and secularists
and “act” as a political community under the guidance of organized Hindutva.
The 6th of December has been celebrated every year since
1992 as the “Shaurya Diwas” (“Valor Day”) by Hindutva
activists. I observed the celebrations on 6 December in 2005
in Ayodhya, the first year since 1992 when the anniversary
coincided with a prominent local Hindu festival—“Ram Sita
Vivah” (“Marriage of Ram and Sita”). Rather than charting the
history and politics of dispute over the Babri Mosque–Ram
Janmabhumi (Ram birthplace), I will focus on the celebration
of the mosque’s destruction and what it says about Hindutva’s
politics of awakening. The second event that I briefly comment
upon here is Gujarat 2002—the large-scale anti-Muslim riots
following the burning of Hindutva activists in a train in the
town of Godhra. Rather than going into an explanation of why
these events occurred, the chapter focuses on the significance
these have acquired within the Hindutva imaginary as symbols

of the awakened Hindu nation. That the awakening cannibalizes upon the victimized Muslim bodies is represented as a
legitimate response to the threatening Muslim Other. What is
also significant in both the sites of investigation is the role of
the state—I argue that while the representations are crucial
in normalizing, justifying, and legitimizing violence against
Muslims, the actual widespread violence cannot be understood
without recognizing the complicity of the state.
Ayodhya
The Ram Janmabhumi movement—the movement to build
a grand temple for Lord Ram at his supposed birthplace in
Ayodhya by destroying the preexisting Babri Mosque—has
acquired an epic significance in the Hindu nationalist imagination. Ayodhya stands out as the best illustration of an awakened
Hindu nation—after centuries of suppression, struggle, sacrifice, patience, duplicity of secularist politicians, and rigidity of
Muslims, the otherwise peaceful Hindu society lashed out against
historical injustice, spontaneously destroyed the symbol of
humiliation (the Babri Mosque), and liberated Ram’s birthplace
for the construction of a grand temple honoring him. As Pandey
reminds us, “The conflict over the Babari Masjid in Ayodhya
is part of a larger Hindu drive to reclaim the national culture
from its enemies—Muslims, but also secularists and westernizers” (Pandey 2006: 68). The destruction of Babri Mosque on
6 December 1992 marks a watershed for Hindu nationalists.
A close analysis of the discourse of Ram Janmabhumi liberation shows how a poetics of fear is intermeshed with a politics
of awakening of the Hindu body politic. In this, the minority
Muslims have no option but to accept their subjugation or
face further violence from the awakened Hindu nation. While
the Hindu nation is given agency as an actor in liberating the
birthplace of Ram, no individual Hindus are recognized as
responsible for the actual destruction of the structure in place
(the Babri Mosque). Ayodhya thus signifies a collective grief (at
the presence of the Babri Mosque on a site believed to be Ram’s
birthplace) and a collective triumph (as the destruction of the
mosque) shared by the awakening Hindu nation.

Events
The complete destruction of the Babri Mosque on 6 December
6 1992 was a culmination of years of campaigning that began
in 1984 under the leadership of the VHP and included several
countrywide and regional rathyatras, yajnas, electoral political
machinations, judicial and governmental (non)interventions,
and communal polarization. While much of the country and
the world saw the bringing down of the mosque as a crisis of
Indian secularism and as an attack on pluralism, it was a joyous
moment of victory for Hindu nationalists and their sympathizers. It was the moment of liberation that now awaits a formal
coronation in the form of building a grand temple in the near
future. As leaders and activists of the VHP, the BJP, and other
bodies remind people repeatedly, it is not the question of structure per se but the concern for the dignity of Hindu people in
their “own holyland/homeland,” and is a “movement to ‘redeem
the honour and self-esteem of crores of Hindus of a free India’”
(Singh 1993: 40). “For the Hindus, a temple at the Shri Ram
Janmabhoomi is not an issue of mere bricks and mortar. It is an
issue of our cultural resurgence and identity, where Shri Rama,
as maryada purushottam, has a prime place of importance. The
movement is an expression of the collective consciousness of
the Hindu ethos . . .” (VHP n.d.).
As can be expected, there are very different narratives about
the disputed and destroyed structure of the Babri Mosque
(often referred to as Ram Janmabhumi/Babri Mosque). Most
professional historians question the certainty of Hindutva.
Some accept the reality of the mosque and question the cynical
use of faith and belief by the VHP and other Hindutva forces
to represent the site of the mosque as the original birthplace of
the mythical figure of Ram; others recognize that a number of
mosques were built over the ruins of preexisting temples or used
materials from old temples, and even though the site is disputed,
one cannot rewrite history by destroying all monuments.
In preindependence India, Ayodhya was a small nondescript
town with no big significance for practising Hindus. Occasional
clashes between various groups (Shias, Sunnis, Hindus) and
court cases meant that both Hindus and Muslims were allowed

to worship on the same site next to each other. In 1949, a statue
of Ram was placed surreptitiously inside the mosque. Though
the then Prime Minister Nehru asked for its removal, the local
politicians and officials dithered and using the court case as
an excuse sealed the site preventing anyone from worshipping
there. In the 1980s, as a result of the VHP-led Ram Janmabhumi
movement, a court judgment on opening the lock for Hindu
worship, the Congress government’s cynical attempt to appeal to
Hindu majoritarianism by allowing the ceremony for bricklaying
(shilanyas) for a future temple, and the rise of a national political
party (BJP) that made the temple its primary electoral plank, the
situation escalated and culminated in the physical obliteration of
the mosque in 1992. Since then, Hindu worshippers were allowed
in the makeshift temple around the statue illegally installed at the
original site of the mosque. In October 2010, a province-level
court (Allahabad High Court) passed a judgment, criticized by
many as a further erosion of secularism, dividing the disputed
land between the Hindus and Muslims while recognizing the
Hindutva argument that the main site (where the Babri Mosque
used to stand) is the birthplace of Ram. The Supreme Court of
India will now have the final say on this.
Scholars have analyzed the Ram Janmabhumi movement and
its destruction of the Babri Mosque extensively. For instance,
in the specific act of vandalism, Raychaudhuri sees signs of
fascism as Hindutva is “a movement of aggressive nationalism
with strong anti-intellectual or non-intellectual overtones”
(Raychaudhuri 2000: 268, see also Ahmad 2003). Both Panikkar
(1993) and Thakur (1993) remind us of the facilitative role
played by the increasingly deinstitutionalized Congress and
the ambivalence of its secularism. According to Thakur, “The
political exploitation of a Hindu sense of grievance was thus
the proximate cause of the Ayodhya tragedy. But the ultimate
cause was the creeping malaise afflicting India’s constitutional
democracy” (Thakur 1993: 658). Muralidharan (1990) analyzes
Hindu nationalism’s efforts to maintain Hindu hegemony
as a response to the political assertion of low-caste Hindus,
while Chibber and Misra (1993) identify the social basis of the
movement. Other scholars see the transformation of Ayodhya

into a site for resurgence of religiosity and communal violence
as a product of the breakdown of traditional social and cultural
ties crossing religious boundaries; emergence of a modern,
ossified, elitist version of religion as a political ideology; and
a politicized middle class (Nandy et al. 1995: 23). Bock (1997)
reminds us that the use of religious symbols in communal
conflicts make the latter more lethal. Van Der Veer through
his detailed research on Ayodhya argues that the sentiments
“aroused by the movement are not ‘primordial,’ but that they
are fragmented and depend on developments in the political
arena” (Van Der Veer 1987: 284) and provides an investigation of the ways religious practices are intertwined with historical circumstances and political-economic manipulations in
Ayodhya (Van Der Veer 1989).
While scholars rightly explain the temple movement in terms of
political transformation taking place in India at the time and highlight its political nature, the Hindutva self-understanding is very
different. For Hindutva, politics is what the secularists/Congress/
Muslims indulge in—the Ram Janmabhumi movement is one of
national awakening and thus above politics. BJP’s White Paper
states: “The Ayodhya movement also clears the confusion as to
what is nationalism and what constitutes the ideal basis for interreligious harmony. It asserts that it is not the spiritually bankrupt
Western concept of secularism, but the assimilative Hindu cultural
nationhood that is the basis for religious harmony.” (BJP 1993) In
this chapter, let me analyze how Ayodhya is an illustration of the
Hindu nationalist politics of fear and anxiety, one where awakening of the Hindu body politics necessarily involves an attack on
symbols associated with Muslims and/or secularism.
The Hindutva narrative today as presented by the RSS, the
BJP, the VHP, and others is straightforward and unidimensional
(see in Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas 2001) and goes along the
following lines. According to Hindu beliefs, Lord Ram was born
in Ayodhya and there was a grand temple to commemorate
that (Chowgule n.d.). Ram Vilas Vedanti, during an interview
with me in 2005, gives a precise number—the temple was built
by Lord Ram’s father 18,160,662 years ago (Personal Interview
2005h). As Babur came to India and established the Mughal

empire, his commander Mir Baqi built the Babri Mosque in 1528
deliberately over a preexisting temple because this was meant to
humiliate the Hindus. Hindus never gave up their struggle, and
the agitation since 1984 is only a recent modern episode in the
long-running war between Hindus and Muslims over the site.
While the destruction of the mosque on 6 December 1992 was
crucial, it is the entire movement of Ram Janmabhumi—the
political movement, infused with religious imageries, to replace
the existing structure (a task that is completed) with a grand
temple for Ram (a task that is remaining)—that reflects the
awakened Hindu nation. The movement’s pinnacle was a singular act of violence—the physical dismembering of the existing
mosque. For the Hindu nationalist activists I spoke to, this act of
destruction perceived as striking a blow to the obstinate Muslims
and arrogant secularists is the best example of what an awakened
Hindu nation is. BJP’s White Paper reminds us:
Thus, the BJP is convinced that the quest for a Temple for
Sri Rama at Ayodhya, at the very place where the Maryada
Purushotam is believed to have been born, is the expression of a
brooding national conscience that had been held in check since
the partition of India by pseudo-secular leaders and parties, that
it is a symbol of the greatest national introspection and cultural
resurgence of the present century. The peoples participation in
the Ayodhya movement and its reach cutting across all barriers
of caste, religion, language and region showed and emphasised
its national and political thrust.”
(BJP 1993)

Denial
The affirmation of the Hindu nation through the Ram
Janmabhumi temple movement is based on a politics of denial.
A denial of the very politics of the movement, a denial of
responsibility for any action, and a denial of the very presence
of the visible architecture of the mosque. For Hindutva there
was no mosque but at most a mosque-like structure. So the
dispute over a physically present Babri Mosque transformed
into the Babri Masjid–Ram Janmabhumi dispute, and since

the obliteration of the mosque in 1992 is referred to as the
Ram Janmabhumi dispute—the Hindutva appropriation of
the discursive site of Ram Janmabhumi is almost complete.
The figure of Ram is transformed as the main symbol of an
awakened Hindu nation, his putative birthplace is sought to
be liberated from Muslim and secular control, and victory is to
be celebrated by constructing a grand temple at the exact spot
where for centuries there was the Babri Mosque.
The head of the Ram Janmabhumi movement, Mahant
Nritya Gopal Das explained to me, “Listen young man, there
was never a mosque; Ram temple is as integral to Hindus as
Mecca and Medina is to the Muslims” (Personal Interview
2005e). In the Hindutva narrative, not only was a mosque never
there, but Ram Lalla (the infant Lord Ram) was always present at his birthplace. A number of my respondents in Ayodhya
and elsewhere told me stories of how when Babur’s official Mir
Baqi went to destroy the idol, the idol disappeared, and hence
the sacrality of the birthplace was maintained. According to a
VHP figure Vedanti, “Mir Baqi failed to locate the idol of Ram
Lalla (it was there but the Muslims could not see it) and while
he built the mosque-like structure, no namaz was offered and
in 1949 Ram Lalla reappeared at midnight” (Personal Interview
2005h). The miraculous appearance, disappearance, and reappearance of the physical idol of Ram are an integral part of
Hindutva historical telling. This absolves individual humans
and political actors from any responsibility as they are represented as mere recipients of god’s play. As Pandey points out,
“A sense of eternal (and united) Hindu activism and sacrifice,
of numbers (which testify again to Hindu strength), and of
a divine play or order (once again revealing the power of the
Hindu) actuates this right-wing reconstruction of the past”
(Pandey 2006: 77).
Hindutva leaders, especially in the recent decades, deny the
very existence of the architecturally present mosque (they call it
“dhancha,” a structure) while affirming the continued existence
of a Ram temple even when structurally there was no temple.
When asked about the demolition of the mosque, Rajendra
Singh, an RSS veteran leader, said, “It was not a mosque at all.

It was a functioning temple” (Singh 1993: 5). The interesting
question is that if the Babri Mosque was not a mosque and if the
site always had a sacred presence of Ram, what was the point of
the movement to build a temple. If it was a functioning temple
within a mosque-like physical structure, why destroy that to
build another temple? The very act of consciously destroying a
preexisting structure (the Babri Mosque) in the name of building a grand temple for Ram (the Ram Janmabhumi temple)
reveals that contrary to the Hindtuva denial of the Babri structure being a mosque, it was nothing but a mosque.
A similar politics of denial also goes in when it comes to
taking responsibility for the bringing down of the mosque.
For instance, next to the disputed site in Ayodhya, shops sell a
number of trinkets, VCDs, and music cassettes mostly celebrating the Ram Janmabhumi movement and its violence. A short
movie, whose Video VCD I picked up in 2005, is called Kar
Seva (Santoshi n.d.). It has the following slogan on its cover:
“Bhakto ka seene pe goliyan khaana, mandir ke khatir khoon
bahaana, dekho Ram ke sache bhakton, 6 Dissambar bhool na
jaana” (“The devotees who braved bullets in their chest, who
sacrificed blood for the cause of the temple; True followers of
Rama remember, never forget 6 December”). It gives a reified
history of the movement. It tells the viewers that the demolition
of the mosque in 1992 was due to the enthusiasm of the few
and the emotional surge of the Hindu samaj (society), and the
state and the political leaders could do nothing to stop this. The
state had the option of either massacring the gathered Hindu
crowd or letting the events take their own course. The Hindu
mob, rather than Hindutva leaders, are the ones who brought
down the mosque. Thus, the leaders and activists belonging to
different Hindu nationalist organizations who were involved in
the temple movement and the destruction of Babri mosque are
absolved of all responsibilities. Not surprising, for crowds “are
regarded as sovereign entities in that they may be dispersed and
controlled by the police as crowds, but individuals are never
held accountable for violence or destruction in the course of
crowd action” (in Hansen 2005: 127–28; on the role of crowds,
see also Brass 1997; Hansen 2008; Tambiah 1996).

The film (Santoshi n.d.) has shots of policemen worshipping Ram’s idol, thus revealing their complicity, and is filled
with Bollywood-style songs. Interestingly, as with Gujarat,
coercive forces of the state—the police—are often seen on the
side of the Hindu society. A young boy took me around for a
tour of Ayodhya pointing out various places where “sacrifices”
were made (a lane is called Shahid Marg/Martyr Lane) by brave
Hindus for years before culminating in 6 December. His elder
brothers were with Bajrang Dal, and his father belonged to the
VHP. He told me stories of how police were seen as enemies
of Hindus in 1990 and 1991 when the state government prevented the Hindu mobs, but were then praised as allies in 1992
when the state government was under the BJP rule. Central
Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men were heard saying, “Sharir
becha hai; Dharma nahin” (“We have mortgaged our body to
the Government, not our faith,” in Malkani 1993: 9; on police
complicity, see also Patwardhan 1994). During my research visit
in December 2005, the policemen I met and interacted with at
the disputed site and other establishments mostly shared the
Hindutva worldview. For instance, on 6 December 2005 I had
a conversation with a policeman who gave his name as Tiwari.
He explained the history of the place to me: “There was always
a temple here, the history of Islam in India has been that of
bloodshed with 7 lakh Hindus sacrificed, the 1992 destruction
occurred only because after allowing the worship, the government dragged its feet, the police didn’t see anything wrong with
the destruction, all evidence after 1992 point to an ancient temple, ‘those terrorists’ are out there to destroy the Ram Temple;
if they succeed they will wipe out Hindus from throughout the
world” (Personal Interview 2005i). Policemen saw themselves
as belonging to the Hindu community rather than as neutral
state officials.
Thus, the destruction of the existing structure of the Babri
Mosque by the kar sevaks in 1992 is ascribed by Hindutva to the
spontaneous emotional outburst of nationalist consciousness
by the hitherto trampled and suppressed Hindus. It is seen as a
“volcanic eruption.” The emphasis is put on the sheer diversity
of Hindus from different regions, castes, and social groups who

came to offer their service for the Ram Janmabhumi (see, for
example, Karseva 1991). “The Hindus are very slow to act, but
when they do rise, even the Himalayas must start trembling”
(Dubashi 1992: 3). Hindu nationalism’s destructive politics as
exemplified by Ayodhya thus reflects an underlying current that
the faithful Hindus need to react to the “challenge of other [religious minority] people’s activism” (Bayly 1993: 12).
Kalyan Singh, the then BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh
and thus in charge of the law and order in Ayodhya, ascribed
the destruction to the act of God, as the “Bal-Lila of Ram Lalla
[Play of young Ram]” (Malkani 1993: 4). No specific organization or leader was seen as responsible for the destruction—it
was the generic Hindu nation that had spoken with one voice:
“Kasam Ram ki khaate hain, mandir wahin banayenge” (“We
swear in the name of Ram, we will build the temple there”). As
the BJP’s White Paper of 1993 points out, the demolition of the
disputed structure was an uncontrolled and, in fact, uncontrollable upsurge of a spontaneous nature, which was provoked
only by the callousness of the government in dealing with
the Ayodhya issue without understanding its sensitive nature
(BJP 1993; on a critique of White Paper, see Srivastava 1994).
A BJP leader muses that the actual vandalism was committed
by the Congress government—backed intelligence operatives
(Malkani 2002: 164–167) while an RSS leader opines that “circumstances suddenly demolished the structure” (Singh 1993:
72). The emphasis now is to avoid any scrutiny and accept
the act of violence as a product of the Hindu awakening:
“Although unexpected and never planned by the organisers of
kar seva, nevertheless it resulted in the removal of the disputed
structure—that blot of foreign slavery on that holy spot” (RSS
leader Rajendra Singh in 1994, in Hartung et al. 2003: 13).
Celebration of the National Resurgence
The 6th of December has been celebrated every year since 1992 as
Shaurya Diwas by the Hindutva activists. Many speakers during
the celebration witnessed by me in 2005 saw it as the true independence day. As the foreword of the BJP’s White Paper makes it

clear, the Babri mosque had a wider significance: “It was purely
and simply a symbol not of devotion and of religion but of conquest. Correspondingly, quite apart from its being an obstacle,
preventing Hindus from worshipping the birthplace of their idol,
Sri Rama, it was for the country the symbol of its subjugation.”
(BJP 1993). Therefore, the destruction was a kind of liberation.
Awasthi, the RSS leader in charge of Ayodhya said that since
Babri was a provocation—“jaise pitaa mar kar tang diya gaya ho”
(“as if father were killed and hanged”)—the physical destruction of 1992 was welcomed for it was as if “kalaa tikaa mit gaya”
(“the black spot has been erased”) (Personal Interview 2005d).
All publications, speeches, and statements of various branches
of Hindu nationalism celebrate the destruction of the mosque
as the sign of national awakening, as an inevitable consequence
of history where Hindus are finally emancipating themselves
after centuries of servitude. As Raychaudhuri points out in his
analysis, for Hindutva the “destruction of a mosque is not a
cause for shame but instead a tremendous morale booster for
the Hindu psyche, in effect an act of liberation” (2000: 262).
The “liberation” of the Ram Janmabhumi and the awakening
of the Hindu nation are seen as mutually dependent.
The Rama Janmabhoomi Movement seeks the release of the
Hindu psyche, which has remained strangulated for centuries.
The country witnessed the educated and sophisticated Hindus
fighting shy in proudly proclaiming themselves as Hindus.
Nothing can be more humiliating for any race or community.
The temple movement is essentially the awakening of the selfesteem, self-respect, the removal of a continuing ocular demonstration of Hindu humiliation and validation of pride in being a
Hindu. The basic ethos of the Shri Rama Janmabhoomi movement is to restore the honour of the Hindu Samaj (society) and
Hindu culture. It is not just an issue of bricks and mortar.
(Singh 1993: 18–19)

Given that the god (Lord Ram in this case) himself is seen on the
side of Hindus, Hindu nationalist leaders remind their followers
of the duty to be karmayogi (a rightful actioner). Suresh Das
(2005a), a sadhu of Digambar Akhara stirred up the public

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

during a festival commemorating 6 December in Ayodhya by
chanting: “Baba sapna pura karenge, mandir ka nirman karenge”
(“Lord will fulfill our dreams and build the temple”). A VCD
(Santoshi n.d.) dedicated to all those Ram bhaktas (followers of
Ram) who gave up their lives for the construction of the Ram
Temple repeats slogans including “jis hindu ka khoon na khole,
woh khoon nahin paani ha” (“a Hindu whose blood does not
boil, has no blood but water”) and “jo ram ke kam na aaye, woh
bekar jawani hai” (“youth that does not come of use to Ram is
a useless one”). The slogans such as these (see VHP 2003) are
meant to rouse the people. As I argued in the previous chapters, Hindutva is a discourse of masculinist nationalism and
nationalizing masculinity. Sen and Wagner quote a respondent
to their research on the Ayodhya movement: “If the temple is
not made . . . then Hindus are not worthy enough to stay in
this country . . . wear bangles, wear saris, live like a woman and
ask their Hindu women to marry Muslim men” (in Sen and
Wagner 2005: 2.13). Exhortations to the kar sevaks throughout
the movement were “replete with appeals to masculine virility,
national pride, racial redemption, contempt for law and civility”
(Ahmad 2003: 5). There was only one way in which Hindutva
men could prove their patriotism, their masculinity; it was by
being uncompromising, by mobilizing, by vandalizing. In a
more detailed study, Udayakumar argues, “Having been brainwashed by the rhetoric of ‘heroic heritage’ of the past and the
‘pathetic situation’ of the present, the ‘Hindu’ youth are made to
feel intensely the need for shunning ‘impotence’ and ‘weakness.’
They are presented with a clear enemy and a visible symbol to
destroy and establish their ‘strength and glory,’ and regain their
‘pride and hegemony’” (Udayakumar 1997: 17). During my conversations with young male activists in Ayodhya and Hardwar, it
was evident that the destruction of the Babri Mosque was seen
as the ultimate manly act by the Hindus (the word that came up
again and again was “mardangi,” virility/masculinity).
History is used and misused to add weight to the Hindutva
arguments. “It is religious intensity, linked with politicized communal feelings, that has made the Ayodhya situation so compelling. The way militant Hindus have structured the narrative of

Ayodhya’s sacred history and bent the epic universe to their definition of Indian national identity is a striking example of how
vulnerable the past is to passions of the moment” (Miller 1991:
790). In this narrativization of history, the meaning of Hindu is
posed as self-evidently opposed to Muslim and as coterminus
with Indian. By fusing a story of historical trauma (resulting
from Muslim-Mughal rule) with the continuing presence of
an actual mosque, which Hindutva claimed to be built over
a sacred Hindu site, Hindutva constructed a Hindu identity
that was inevitably antagonistic to Muslims. One can see this
antagonism in Elst’s description of the movement: “The NorthIndian town of Ayodhya became world famous in 1989–1992
when Hindus and Muslims clashed over a mosque structure
used by the Hindus as a temple but claimed by the Muslims as
the Babri Masjid” (2002, chapter 9). Elst, a pro-Hindutva rightwing ideologue turns the story on its head as he naturalizes the
Hindutva claims. Even as ideologues like him talk of HinduMuslim clash, the bulk of Ayodhya movement-related violence
was committed by Hindu nationalists. The victimization of
Muslims and the overwhelming violence inflicted upon them is
ignored. Muslims can never be deserving victims in the Hindu
nationalist imagination.
In VHP’s history-telling, the Hindu community, like the
temple, is “already fully constituted from the start,” and the
“loss of territory, site, self-respect occurs only when the Hindu
community/nation, or its rulers, turn away from the Ram
Janmabhumi, that is, from religion” (Pandey 1995: 386–387).
Modern Hindutva is thus legitimized by giving it a history.
Continuous resistance and struggle is repeated in most articles
and resources available from ayodhya.com and hinduunity.org.
For example, look at the following tale from a Hindutva tract:
The Temple at Bhagwan Ram’s birthplace was destroyed in 1528
CE and the Babri structure was built in its place. The objective
was a political one to provide an ocular reminder to the Hindus
that Islam ruled over their holy land. Thus it was a monument
of Hindu slavery. The struggle to repossess the birthplace of
Bhagwan Ram has been going on for the last 478 years. It is a

program for upholding the dignity and showing devotion to
Bhagwan Ram. Lakhs of Hindu lives have been sacrificed in this
struggle.
(HVK n.d.)

Ram is celebrated as both a sacred mythological figure (hence
beyond reproach and questioning) and a historical one (only
then can a birthplace be fixed to a specific geographical site).
The Ram Janmabhumi movement uses various manifestations
of Ram to catalyze specific aspects of politics. For instance, the
Bajrang Dal was created after 1984 (Bajrang Bali is Hanuman,
the faithful companion of Ram) to act as a defender force. The
Ayodhya Temple is about Ram lalla (baby Ram). Yet, the most
common picture of Ram that mushroomed during the movement was the one with a well-defined body (see Kapur 1993).
While Ram is respected as a god and an ideal king, the use of his
stories are not always asexual. For instance, a sadhu (Vaishnav
Das 2005), during Hardwar Dharma Sansad, made the following
statement about Ram’s marriage to Sita after he won the challenge against all other suitors: “Swayamvara [ceremony where
the bride chooses her suitors] of Janaki [Sita] was like a modern
beauty contest, imagine if all 10,000 men had met the challenge
posed by Sita’s father, what would have happened to a woman
shared by 10,000 men.” Given that this statement was preceded
by a denunciation of “witches” (dayan) like Sonia Gandhi and
Mayawati, the two most powerful female secular politicians in
India, and was greeted by laughter and chuckle from the audience of sadhus and activists, the attitude of Hindutva leaders
toward women becomes obvious. Vaishnav Das hastened to then
add that Ram was great because he put an end to this uncivilized
practice of a woman having more than one suitor.
Apart from the specific context of Ram Janmabhumi (that
there was a mosque over a site claimed by some to be the exact
birthplace of a Hindu God), it is also important to note that the
epic Ramayana (of which Ram is a figure) with its tale of morality and good and evil, does lend itself to an easy retelling that is
about antagonism. As Pollock points out in his detailed study,
“I believe the text offers unique imaginative instruments—in
fact, two linked instruments—whereby, on the one hand, a

divine political order can be conceptualized, narrated, and historically grounded, and, on the other, a fully demonized Other
can be categorized, counterposed, and condemned” (1993: 264).
The Babri Mosque was conjured up as the humiliating symbol
of demonic Muslim rule, which the Hindu nation had to liberate
with the blessing of the divine forces. Reflecting upon various
political developments in India in the 1980s, including insurgencies in Punjab, Kashmir, and Assam, a pro-Hindutva intellectual
Bajaj justifies the Ram Temple movement as an inevitable reaction of the beleaguered Hindu majority. He argues that at times
of attacks on national integrity and secessionist movements by
minorities, nations “revert to their roots,” to their
civilizational moorings to redefine themselves and reassess the
way. The people of India thus sought refuge in Srirama. They
tried to find solace in Him. Through Him they tried to rediscover the essence of being Indian<undo> and recapture the lost
spirit of Indian-ness. And, they tried to reawaken their determination as a nation by dedicating themselves to the building of
a great temple to Srirama at His birthplace in Ayodhya. In the
effort to build the temple, they were in fact trying to rebuild
themselves.
(Bajaj 1993: 37)

Rajendra Singh of the RSS denied there was any politics involved
in the Ayodhya movement. “There is a veiled and not-so-veiled
suggestion that we are out to create a Hindu vote bank by building a Ram temple . . . Nothing could be farther from truth. We
are not against any community . . . It would be absurd to suggest
that political power is what those of us in RSS have in mind.
Ours is a movement for national consciousness . . .” (Singh 1993:
16). Not only does this claim fly in the face of the BJP, which
has been fighting elections by making the Ram Temple its main
plank, but it also betrays a limited understanding of politics. The
RSS may or may not be concerned about day-to-day electoral
politics, but it clearly seeks to shift the content to nationalist
politics in India away from secularism.
The political message of the Ram Janmabhumi movement
is unmistakable. It is not only about building a specific temple.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

It is directly connected to Hindutva’s vision for an India where
Muslim minorities accept the terms of integration offered by
the Hindu extremists. Elst, with his quotes appearing on several Web sites, echoes the polemic of several Hindutva leaders
when he says the temple movement offers “an invitation to the
Muslim Indians to reintegrate themselves into the society and
the culture from which their ancestors were cut off by fanatical rulers and their thought police, the theologians. It is thus
an exercise in national integration” (Elst 1991). A Hindutva
writer blames Muslims for obstinacy and refusing to give up
the mosque: “A historic opportunity for genuine and long-term
Hindu-Muslim understanding, offered by repeated and passionate pleas by Hindu organizations for the Ramjanmabhoomi site
in Ayodhya, has been thrown away” (Jain 1992). The polemic
is that the present-day Muslims should “return” at the very
least three holy sites where temples and mosques exist in the
same place or side by side—Ayodhya, Mathura, and Varanasi.
Prashant Bhaiya, a young RSS man in Hardwar recited his
poem to me: “Mathura kaashi ab bhi baaki hai, yeh to pehli angrai hai; samay bankuri Raghava ke, tumko sau baar badhai hai”
(“Mathura and Kashi are still left, this is just a start; O followers
of Raghava, heartiest congratulations to you”). Discussing this
with the activists in Nagpur and Ayodhya, I got a clear sense
that they do not expect the “reasonable” demand from the VHP
to be accepted by Muslims and even if they were proven wrong,
they will not trust the Muslims.
The following quote from the VHP makes clear a link
between the liberation of the Ram Janmabhumi and a discourse
of the Muslim location within Hindu India: “[The VHP] has
sincerely felt that India’s experiment in secularism will succeed
only when the present generation of Indian Muslims disassociate themselves from the medieval ideology of religious exclusivism, expansionism and iconoclasism, pursued by foreign
invaders like Babur or by intolerant rulers like Aurangzeb and
glorification of such acts of vandalism in the name of religion.”
(VHP 1999).
Though Hindu nationalists claim that Ayodhya is not antiMuslim: “The Ram Janmabhoomi movement is not designed

to open old wounds but to heal them. These wounds are those
that have been inflicted on the Hindus” (Chowgule 1997: 3)—it
is clear from their statements and actions that the movement
is antagonistic to Muslims. As Panikkar points out, Ayodhya
became “a site for constructing Hindu solidarity and avenging
the Muslim wrong” (Panikkar 1993: 67). For instance, a VHP
booklet, while discussing the Ram Janmabhumi movement as a
national awakening, ends up exposing its own Islamobhobia in
its conclusion: “This struggle, in short, is the one between those
who consider themselves as Babar’s progeny and those who feel
proud of calling themselves the descendants of Sri Rama. It is
clear therefore that the present achievement is one more victorious step in the culmination of the relentless struggle by the
Hindu Nation against the Islamic aggression of 1000 years” (The
Saga n.d.: 27). As I mentioned before, “Babur ki aulad” (Babur’s
children) is a pejorative description of Indian Muslims. A sadhu
spoke bluntly to me: “If Ram temple is not built, Muslims will
be bolstered and in no time another Pakistan will be created”
(Das, N. 2005). These leave no room for doubt that an antiMuslim agenda is integral to this movement that occasionally
claims to be about “liberation” of certain religious sites.
In the Hindutva’s imagination, Hindus are always at the
edge—the edge of patience, tolerance, and acceptance. The
Hindus have been long suppressed in their home by foreign
religionists and traitors, but their patience has a limit. The
actions of the VHP, Bajrang Dal, and others are naturalized as
resulting from the impatience of the hitherto suppressed Hindu
majority. Hindutva represents its own violence as a spontaneous outburst of the hitherto pacified Hindu nation. “The liberation of the Shri Rama Janma Bhumi is a question of prestige
and dignity for the entire Hindu samaj. Hindu society has been
insulted in this matter for long and it will not tolerate it any
longer” (Sri Rama Janma Bhumi Mukti Yajna samiti’s statement in September 1987, cited in Hartung et al., 2003: 116).
Hindu nationalist intolerance thus masks itself as an inevitable
manifestation of the Hindu nation lashing out after centuries
of humiliation by Muslims and others. The Babri Mosque’s
destruction was portrayed as a product of Hindu impatience.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Rajendra Singh, a senior RSS leader, argued that 6 December
was a watershed, for the “Hindu has decided not to take everything lying down. If justice is not meted out to him, he will
react” and this is the “real import of the Ayodhya incidents”
(Singh 1993: 17).
Since 1992, as the court cases drag on and the political class
recognizes the limits of tying electoral politics too closely to
a temple movement, the VHP and its sadhus repeatedly warn
of Hindu patience running out. Not surprising then that the
massacre of several hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002
was seen as a direct result of killing scores of Hindutva activists associated with the Ram Janmabhumi movement. In 2005
Hardwar Dharma Sansad, Krishnacharya Maharaj, in a public
speech, was goading the temple movement to radicalize further.
Referring to the earlier killing of the Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi in 1984, he joked to a receptive applauding audience,
“Bahut dekha hai striyon ko solah shringar karte, pehli bar dekha
ek stri ko solah goli khaate” (“I have often seen women decking
themselves but saw a woman being decorated with 16 bullets
for the first time”). And then he promised to cajole other religious men to distribute through their mandirs and maths, VHP
literature about the dangers posed by Muslims and about the
rejuvenation of Ram Janmabhumi movement (Krishnacharya
Maharaj 2005).
Ayodhya is not a movement in itself; it is interconnected
with Hindu nationalism (often oscillating between moderate
and militant approaches toward Ram Janmabhumi depending
on the political context; see Jaffrelot 1999) and its politics of
fear and intolerance. During a discussion during the Dharma
Sansad on 14 December 2005 in Hardwar, the VHP, in one of
the resolutions, reaffirmed its commitment to liberating the
land and even assures Hindus worldwide that not only will they
build a temple, but they will prevent any mosque from being
built in the precinct or anywhere else in the Ayodhya region:
“The community of religious figures (sant samaj) gives assurance to the Hindus worldwide they will categorically not allow
the building of any mosque as an alternative to the destroyed
structure either within the Shri Ramjanmabhoomi precinct or

Ayodhya’s cultural boundaries, even if they will require more
sacrifices.” Hindutva has a moral certainty about its mission to
militarize Hinduism and Hinduize India and the recovery of
“self-esteem” through the destruction of the Babri Mosque has
played a crucial role in it.
Thus, the temple movement has a significance beyond
the specific demands. It is Hindu nationalism in practice. As
Christensen reminds us, “As the drive to build the Ram temple
at Ayodhya was inextricably linked to the VHP’s action plan for
cultural rejuvenation of the Hindu nation, the scheme must be
viewed not only as a powerful means of mapping and reclaiming sacred Hindu spaces, but as a cultural symbol buttressing
a conception of Hindu identity deeply embedded in Hindu
nationalist ideology” (Christensen 2003: 175). It is an illustration of what a Hindu nation will look like—deindividualized,
intolerant, antisecular, anti-Muslim, men and women driven by
a religious fervor to transform India’s body politic.
Let me now make some observations about a specific ethnographic site—the event Shaurya Diwas celebrated by Hindu
nationalists on 6 December to commemorate the bringing
down of the Babri Mosque. My experience is from 2005.
The local RSS leader reminded me that “Shaurya Diwas is
another episode in the long history of war between Hindus
and Muslims; even during the Muslim rule, Hindu resistance
continued. The destruction of the Babri Mosque was a result
of this history, [because of] anger of Hindu samaj, a result of
boiling blood, an expression of valour, and a landmark since
it showed the strength of Hindu samaj” (Personal Interview
2005d). The event included chants and a number of sadhus
making short speeches in the Kar Sewak Puram, a well-guarded
establishment in Ayodhya. The slogans included “Bacchaa bacchaa Ram kaa, janmabhoomi ke kaam ka” (“Each and every
child belongs to Rama and is useful for the Janmabhoomi”)
and “Mar jayenge, mit jayenge, mandir wahin banayenge” (“We
will die, we will be erased, but we shall build the temple at that
very place”).
Religious leaders criticized what they called the antinational temperament of minorities, duplicity of secularists,

and passivity of Hindus in general. Mahant Nritya Gopal Das
explained to the media people that 6 December is more than
a Shaurya Diwas, in fact, it is the the true “Swatantra Diwas”
(Independence Day). The speakers mocked those Muslims and
their supporters who commemorate the day as that of mourning. For example, a speaker criticized those who treat the day as
“Gam Diwas” (Mourning Day) and argued, “It should be obvious to you who is marking this day of mourning, their mourning will now never end. If they want to mourn, they should
leave India” (Das, Kanhaiya 2005). While he did not name the
Muslims, it was obvious to everyone that he was referring to
them. A sadhu, Ram Swarup Das, made numerous references
to the recent earthquake in Kashmir that had killed tens of
thousands of Muslims as a “divine punishment” and shouted to
a loud cheer: “Aur bhi bhayanak bhookampa aayega, agar kala
diwas manayega, agan mandir main sammilit nahin ho to, aur
bhi bada bhokampa aayega” (“An even more dangerous quake
will come, if you mark the mourning day, if you do not join the
temple movement, an even bigger quake will come”) (Das, Ram
Swarup 2005). Ram Vilas Vedanti, a VHP leader I encountered a
number of times in Ayodhya and Hardwar during my research,
did not mince his words: “Katle aam karna chahiye, kali patti
bandhne walon ke hathon ko tod do” (“We should massacre,
the hands of those who tie the black band must be broken”)
(Vedanti 2005).
While Nritya Gopal Das asked his followers to respect all
security personnel, Kanhaiya Das cajoled Hindus to avenge
“four lakh Hindu souls” who had died fighting the Muslims and
assured them that the army men will not fire at the agitating
Hindus because their mothers would be Ram worshippers too.
Kanhaiya Das warned Muslims against any opposition to the
Ram temple in Ayodhya (“Agar koi mulla ya kathmulla virodh
karega, kabra pehle banayenge!” “If any muslim leader or quasileader opposes, we will dig his grave first”). And he reserved
his choicest abuse for Congress politician Sonia Gandhi by
comparing her to vamps from ancient legends. “Bhabhi ban
kar raho nahin to tera bhi naak kaan Shurpanakha ki tarah kat
kar Italy bhej doonga” (“Live like a sister-in-law, otherwise like

Shurpanakha, I will cut your nose and ears and send you off
to Italy”) (Das, Kanhaiya 2005). Amrish of the Bajrang Dal
declared that since the Babri Mosque was a symbol of servitude (“paradheenta ka prateek”), building of a grand temple
for Ram is inevitable: “If some people support, they will be
taken along; if some are neutral, they will be put aside; if some
are opposed, we will trample on their chest” (Amrish Ji 2005).
Mahant Sharad Kishori (of VHP) reminded his audience that
the struggle is more than one for a temple, it is a fight for the
nation: “Ram mandir is fine, but Rashtra mandir [‘National
Temple’] is the higher goal” (Kishori 2005). And Suresh Das of
Digambar Akhara called for a struggle not only for India as it
exists today, but for regaining an undivided India: “We need to
struggle for Akhanda Bharat (Undivided India) by incorporating Pakistan and only then can we defeat Islam and Terrorism”
(Das 2005a).
Thus, we see Hindu nationalists launching and indulging in
the temple movement not only to defend a specific religious
right to worship, but, more importantly, to promote a vision
of Hindu nation. A vision that demands the Hindu population
to rise up against the dangers posed by minorities and work as
a single corporate body of a Hindu nation under the aegis of
Hindutva parties.
Visiting a Site of Communal Violence: Gujarat 2002
The anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002 was masked as
“inevitable” and “understandable” acts to secure the Hindu Self.
The (meta)discourse of security offered the forces of Hindutva
a tool to legitimize violence as nonviolence, killers as defenders,
rape as understandable lust, and death as non-death. I do not
go into details of the violence and explanations of it here (see
An Independent 2002; Cohn 2003; “Genocide Gujarat” 2002;
Lessons 2003; Mander 2002; Report 2003; Vardarajan 2003).
What I propose is one of the ways in which we can make sense
of the complicity of a significant number of Hindus in this
violence, borrowing the analysis from various reports mentioned above. It is a politics of fear along the lines discussed

in the previous chapters that dehumanizes minorities, instils a
sense of anxiety among Hindus, and allows Hindutva to legitimize their actions as a product of awakening of the hitherto
overly patient Hindu nation.
During February 2002 the VHP was carrying on with its
agitation over the building of a grand temple in Ayodhya. After
an altercation, one coach of the Sabarmati Express, a train
returning from Ayodhya and carrying many Hindu kar sevaks
(activists), was burned at the Godhra station in Gujarat on 26
February killing 58 people. What followed for the next couple
of months was massive communal violence in which most of
the victims were Muslims. Though Hindutva forces painted
this overwhelmingly anti-Muslim violence, in which hundreds
were killed, as a reaction to Godhra, documented evidence
points to four crucial features of this violence that challenge the
“riots-as-post-Godhra-reaction” thesis. First, there was active
state complicity—through police inaction (see Human Rights
Watch 2002); frequent police participation in anti-Muslim
violence; hate speeches by members of the state government
and the ruling BJP; active participation of local and state leaders in fomenting violence; and availability of lists of Muslim
establishments (data privy to the government) to the Hindu
mobs. Second, there was a conscious and well-orchestrated preplanning for communal violence through activities of various
Hindutva organizations. Third, organizations such as the VHP
used the train incident as an excuse to “teach Muslims a lesson” through vicious uses of brutality. Fourth, the ruling party,
the BJP, used this to buttress its political position—a strategy
that succeeded with the BJP coming to power with a greater
majority in a snap election. In a few months’ time, the violence
subsided, but the hatred and its legacy remain as the struggle
for rebuilding lives and securing justice continues. Following
the actual violence, over years Hindu nationalists and their supporters have sought to trivialize the incident, blaming it on the
“wicked, conspiratorial terroristic mentality” of Muslims (VSK
2002: 1), adopting a victimization paradigm where the Hindus
and the Hindutva leaders are the victims of secularist smear
campaigns, and legitimizing it as a spontaneous reaction for

which no one (except the Muslims) is responsible. For instance,
in a collection of the Hindutva sympathizers, Bhosle argues that
“without tinder, sparks are useless” and justifies anti-Muslim
violence, “the devout Hindus have already compromised by
asking for just 3 sites from among thousands. It is now up to
the parent [secularist and leftist media] to cajole or threaten
the spoilt child [Muslim leadership] and teach him how to
share with his sibling. Otherwise, further pampering = added
estrangement = more riots. QED” (Bhosle 2003: 27).
What makes the spectacle of anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat
2002 extraordinary is its banality and its “participative” nature.
Class, gender, age, or caste were not a barrier either for the willing participants or for the unwilling victims. Not surprisingly,
the RSS then passed a resolution in March 2002: “The reaction of this murderous incident [the Godhra train incident] in
Gujarat was natural and spontaneous. The entire Hindu society cutting across all divisions of party, caste and social status
reacted. It is unfortunate that a number of people died in the
violence that erupted” (in Rao 2003: 63). It is interesting to note
that the killing of scores of Hindutva activists is condemned
as “murderous” while the massacre of hundreds of Muslims
is regretted as unfortunate after justifying it as “natural and
spontaneous.”
It is not sufficient to explain this phenomenon in instrumental terms alone. While interests did play an important role (for
instance, looting, grabbing of land, occupying houses, settling
scores), it was not the sole determining factor. For the majority
who did not benefit in instrumental terms but still accepted
Hindutva versions of the violence and voted with their feet
by reelecting the BJP in the Assembly polls, it was the imagined subjectivity of the victims (dangerous, fanatic, violent,
and hence to be blamed for provoking Hindus) that was the
important factor. It is these dehumanized representations of
the Other as a danger that offer us a good handle to understand
the normalization of abnormal violence and the construction of a secure Hindu identity through the humiliation and
extermination of other identities. Elst in his introduction to a
collection of pro-Hindutva articles blames the violence on the

“nexus between India’s vanguard secularists and anti-Indian
forces in Washington and Islamabad” and reminds us that there
“are limits to the Hindu capacity for tolerance” (Elst 2003).
Another Hindutva ideologue reminds his readers: “The main
problem is the appeasement of Muslims by the government
and it can only lead to a vicious cycle of violence and counter
violence” and “If you desire to see the end of this, then the
deplorable partisan attitude of saying that the Muslim blood is
blood and the Hindu blood is water must end” (Saurabh Shah
in Vishva Samvad Kendra 2002: 15).
The approving statements of a Hindu man (a non-participant middle-class professional man), quoted by Cohn (2003),
reflect a sentiment that was widespread during the riots in
Gujarat in 2002: “Muslim boys, even married ones, try to have
friendships with Hindu girls. I tell you, most Muslim guys are
very good looking, and Hindu girls are very innocent—once
they give you their heart, it’s easily broken . . . I personally feel
they’re spoiling the lives of these Hindu girls. Our blood gets
hot. We can’t stand them . . . It’s time that the Hindus fight
violence with violence.”
The need to secure the Hindu female body against the
danger of the putative Muslim was therefore seen as one of
the rationales for violence against Muslims (for a detailed
treatment, see Report 2003). Aseem Shukla writes of his experience during the riots and says how after Godhra, because
of headlines and news reports, “impotent rage” was building
on the streets of Gujarat (Shukla 2003: 55; emphasis in original). Gujarat 2002 was a lesson in masculinization showing,
through the defeat and humiliation of Muslim men, who the
“real men” are. The slogan “Jis Hinduon ka khoon na khola, woh
Hindu nahin, woh hijra hain” (“Those Hindus whose blood
does not boil, are not Hindus, they are eunuchs”) chanted
by the student wing of the BJP at a premier university in
Delhi during a post-Godhra procession (see Sarkar, T. 2002)
illustrates this obsession with manhood. Various displays of
violent sexuality emphasized Hindu manhood as the violent
protector of Hindus and sought to highlight the impotency of
“the Muslim” in the face of an awakened Hindu nation. The

reaction of Pravin Togadia, a leader of the VHP, in the aftermath of Godhra is significant: “Hindu Society will avenge the
Godhra killings. Muslims should accept the fact that Hindus
are not wearing bangles. We will respond vigorously to all such
incidents” (An Independent 2002).
Pamphlets exhorting Hindu men not to feel guilty about raping Muslim women; regional Gujarati newspapers sensationalizing false stories about Hindu girls being raped; Hindutva
ideologues hammering on about the historic rape of the Hindu
women and the nation at the hands of Muslims; distribution of
bangles (an ornamental marker of femininity) to Hindu men
who did not participate; punishing (through killing, boycott,
and hate campaigns) of Hindu men and women who were
seen as helping Muslims—all these show that the macabre
display of “tolerance,” “passion,” and “reaction” (these were the
self-serving terms used by various proponents of Hindutva to
characterize the anti-Muslim violence) was anything but spontaneous (for detailed reports, see “Genocide Gujarat” 2002).
It shows the construction of a particular form of masculinity
through acts of violence, a masculinity that declares itself as the
protector of the security of Hindu bodies as well as the Hindu
body politic. When asked about sexual violence and rape during the riots, the defense minister of India at the time, George
Fernandez , part of the BJP-led alliance government, retorted:
“There is nothing new in the mayhem let loose in Gujarat . . .
A pregnant woman’s stomach being slit, a daughter being raped
in front of a mother aren’t a new thing” (Concerned Citizens
Tribunal 2002). On the other hand, Keshavram Kashiram
Shastri, 96-year-old chairman of the Gujarat unit of the VHP,
explained this in terms of “Lust and anger are blind,” “Our boys
were charged,” and the rioters being “well-bred Hindu boys”
(Rediff 2002).
A majority of the people in the affected areas of Gujarat
did not participate directly in the violence. However, neither
was there any massive protest against the violence. Many
nongovernmental organizations and citizens groups did not
speak out in strong terms condemning the violence. “All
sides should calm down” is seen as implying that no one is

responsible. The silent majority’s inaction in Gujarat 2002
was an action loaded in favor of those perpetrating antiMuslim violence. The BJP state leadership, which was clearly
identified as complicit with the Gujarat-2002 killing machinery, was confident of gaining electorally after the riot, and
the fact that this confidence paid off is an indictment of the
silent majority. The BJP chief minister of the state, accused
for his complicity and instigation of violence, was rewarded
with electoral victories. “Hats off to the asli mard [real man]”
praised a fan on his Web site (in Bunsha 2002). This electoral
victory in the State Assembly elections of December 2002,
the best performance ever by the BJP on its own in any state
in India until then, challenged most factors that are seen as
important in the electoral democracy in India (e.g., the antiincumbency factor, the lack of development, and the strength
of the opposition) and showed that violence against Muslims
paid off. This cannot be explained by the instrumental interests of the Hindu majority alone but by the lack of compassion for the Muslim victims. There was a curious reversal of
responsibility as many Hindus blamed Muslims for the violence and saw themselves as the victims whose security was
threatened by “the Muslim.”
The attitude of my Hindutva respondents during the 2005–
2006 fieldwork toward anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in
2002 ranged from “unfortunate but well-deserved” to unmitigated celebration. Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the head of Ram
Janmabhumi Trust, brushed off stories of gang rape by saying:
“You are educated, you should surely know that rape is committed only by a man over a woman and gang rape is not possible . . .
since the reports mention gang rapes, they are surely fabricated . . . When 100–220 people went to burn Muslim houses,
how would they all rape women?” Slightly frustrated with my
repeated questions about Gujarat 2002, he said with a finality:
“Gujarat was a reaction—if someone kills your loved ones, you
will of course retaliate, ‘isme galti kya hai?’ (What is wrong with
this?’)”; for Nritya Gopal Das, as for most other leaders and
activists I spoke to, the state was innocent, uninvolved, and helpless against the tide of Hindu awakening.

On the other hand, young activists and some Hindutva sympathizers were more frank. “We are proud that we killed at least
25,000 Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. If Muslims respond, fine,
we will teach them a lesson again,” bragged a VHP activist in
front of an approving crowd in Hardwar (Personal Interview
2005a). SS, a policeman in the town of Ayodhya, rationalized the well-documented reports of sexual violence against
Muslims with this comment: “If rape did occur in Gujarat, so
what, it is what they [the Muslims] did in the past, they did it to
the Kashmiri [Hindu] women. Gujarat kanda [incident] in fact
reduced rape by warning Muslims that the Hindus will respond
in kind” (Personal Interview 2005b).
While activists are more open in their celebration of violence, leaders would focus on explaining, justifying, legitimizing, and thus encouraging violence. Togadia is clear in
his statement: “When the secularists selectively condemn
the Gujarat violence, it seems that without Sita haran (Sita’s
abduction) the Lanka dahan (Lanka’s burning) is imagined.
So if you have to criticize the Gujarat carnage, you must also
condemn the Kashmir killings as well as the Godhra massacre” (in The Milli Gazette n.d.). Togadia is not making a case
for a balanced scrutiny of all killings, but merely representing
Hindutva violence as a reaction to the dangers posed by the
minorities and their secularist allies. Ram Vilas Vedanti justified anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat as an inevitable reaction
(“pratikriya”) and argued that “agar Godhra kanda galat hai,
to Gujarat kanda sahi hai” (“If Godhra incident is wrong, then
Gujarat incident is correct”) and rubbished any suggestion of
sexual violence by stating categorically, “Hindus do not rape
women, Muslims do” (Personal Interview 2005h).
SS, a policeman guarding a VHP leader, explained why
anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat should be a matter of
pride—Western education has spoilt many Hindus, he has
witnessed through his assignment how sadhus and the VHP
have instilled a new pride among young men, it is mostly
Hindus who die in communal riots, and finally, it is refreshing to see Hindus killing more Muslims and proving that they
are not emasculated (Personal Interview 2005b). Clearly for

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

Hindutva leaders, activists, and sympathizers, anti-Muslim
violence in Gujarat 2002 was an episode in the masculinistnationalist awakening of the Hindus. Violence against actual
minorities was celebrated as nationalist awakening of the
majoritarian community imagined as under siege from hostile
forces of foreign (and minority) religionists and their secularist supporters.

Politics of Fear

H

indu nationalist politics of imagination geared around
the dangerous Other and an awakened Self facilitates a
number of processes. It allows political mobilization in the
name of cultural defense, promotes a majoritarian nationalism
in the name of challenging “pseudo-secularism,” justifies antiminority-violence, promotes homosocial bonding, provides a
vision of India as a Hindu nation purged of minorities, and
legitimizes themselves perpetually in the name of defense of the
Hindu nation (because the reality is that India is not a Hindu
nation).
Mobilizing Desire, Desiring Mobilization
How does a sharing of tacit knowledge about the Other translate into political organization? Can a nationalist movement
be built upon desire alone? The answers to these questions can
never be simple for they will depend on the shifting and contesting dynamics within different contexts. As Mines reminds
us, how people appropriate the national for their own placemaking in the local (Mines 2002) is context dependent. In their
research on the Shiva Sena in Maharastra, Katzenstein, Mehta,
and Thakkar argue:
The discourse of religious nationalism derives its power in part
from a transposition of language, ideology, and rhetoric that
heightens the politics of identity. But the power of discourse

also depends crucially on the capacity or incapacity of organizations to make any particular set of competing discursive claims
“stick.” In the case of Shiv Sena, Hindutva, and Maharashtra,
this has everything to do with the Sena’s organizational wizardry and coercive practices and with the weakened institutional structures in the state of Maharashtra.
(1997: 372)

In this book, I have confined myself to identifying and analyzing the overarching frames of representations that are central to
Hindu nationalism. Using the examples of the destruction of the
Babri Mosque in Ayodhya in 1992 and the anti-Muslim violence
in Gujarat in 2002, I illustrated how the framings translate into
certain types of Hindu nationalist political actions.
Nationalism has typically sprung from masculinized memory, masculinized humiliation, and masculinized hope (Enloe
1989: 44). Hindu nationalism illustrates this clearly. It fantasizes potency (of a Hindu collective), yet it fears impotency.
Nationalism, for Hindutva, is a politicocultural project to create,
awaken, and strengthen a masculinist-nationalist body (see also
Bacchetta 2004; Banerjee 2005; Gupta 2001; Jayawardena and De
Alwis 1998). I analyzed Hindu nationalism by conceptualizing
it as a porno-nationalism. Hindu nationalism, as a narcissistic
ideology, has at its core a sexualized conception of sometimes
the Self and often the Other; and at the level of nationalized corporeal bodies too, sexual desire and “perversions” play a crucial
role (see Kabbani 1986; Lewis 1996; McClintock 1995; Said 1978;
and Stoler 2002, 1995 on imperialism, nationalism, and sexuality). Jokes, slogans, gossip, and conversations of young male
activists laced with sexual themes are ethnographically relevant.
Such a porno-nationalist imagination of the hypersexualized
Muslim Other convinces the Hindu nationalist Self of its moral
superiority but at the same time instils an anxiety about the
threatening masculine Other. Hindu nationalism, despite claiming to represent the majority Hindu community, has at its core a
deep masculinist anxiety that it claims, will be solved through a
masculinist, often bordering on militarized, awakening.
In the case of Hindu nationalists, the porno-nationalist
imagination of the hypersexualized Muslim Other and anxious

Hindu masculinity facilitates, rather than directly causes, sociocultural mobilization and political organization. That is, the
imagination does not directly lead to political action; in this
context, prejudices against Muslim minorities do not translate
into automatic violence against them. Political action, including political violence, is a multifaceted phenomenon and imaginative practices are one of the many contributing dynamics.
The anxiety generated by the threatening images of the inimical
Other is tapped by the Hindu nationalists to socioculturally
mobilize supporters. Popular cultural resources and social
practices, such as religious festivals, pilgrimages, songs, cheap
CDs and VCDs, epics, and so on, are utilized to expand the
support base for the Hindu nationalist movement. Homosocial
bonding is clearly the biggest strength of the Hindu nationalist
movement, probably more so than any other social/political
movement in India. The Sangh’s practice of encouraging regular
shakhas (branch) in different parts of India, combining games,
prayers, exercises, and discussions, facilitate bonding like no
other political movement. The porno-nationalist imagination
of the Other, the claim to be the only protector of the vulnerable Hindu Self, and the attractiveness of being part of a selfidentified masculine nationalist project have all proven effective
means for mobilizing young Hindu boys and men, especially in
small towns where there are limited alternatives.
However, this sociocultural mobilization of Hindu nationalism has not easily translated into political organization; hence,
despite the widespread activities of the Hindu nationalist
movement, politically they face a strong challenge from other
centrist, caste-based, regionalist, and leftist forces. Even when
the BJP, a Hindu nationalist party, came to power in the federal
government, it did so by shunning some of the policy ideas
that made it Hindu nationalist (see Adeney and Saez 2005).
Political compulsion to secure support from various regional
and centrist parties forced it to tone down its Hindu nationalist rhetoric and reach out to the minorities. My fieldwork
suggests that the limited political gains of Hindu nationalists
in the elections so far do not reflect the more deep-rooted and
widespread sociocultural networks of Hindutva organizations.

HINDU NATIONALISM IN INDIA

A medium-ranked Hindu nationalist activist who said he was
Mishra from Delhi opined that “muthi bhar musalman ke nak
mein bhi aapna kel dal sakte hain” (“we can easily control a
handful of Muslims if only we organize”; Personal Interview
2005c). All that is needed is a small group of committed and
organized Hindutva activists who shake up the wider Hindu
population. They will have to purge the Hindu body politic
of its putative emasculation. For instance, note the following
description of the Bajrang Dal:
The Bajrang Dal has been proven as a security ring of Hindu
Society. Whenever there is an attack on Hindu Society, Faith
and Religion, the workers of Bajrang Dal come forward to its
rescue. The Hindu Society and the Faith have been kicked and
insulted by various forces for the last fourteen hundred years.
Demolitions of more than 3,000 temples, fraudulent or forceful
conversion of crores of Hindus were the main tactics of these
forces. The Bajrang Dal endeavours to put up resistance by
democratic means against these unholy forces.
(Hinduunity.org n.d.)

The Productive Discourse of Security
Security is a central concept in the theory and praxis of not only
international relations but local, interlocal, as well as translocal
relations. In positivist literature on security, it is assumed to
possess an ontological and epistemological certainty where the
sources of insecurity as well as the referent of security are givens. In line with the literature of critical international relations
(see Campbell 1998; Krause and Williams 1997; Lipschutz 1995;
Weldes et al. 1999), I conceptualize security as a productive
discourse that produces insecurities to be operated upon and
also defines the identity of the object to be secured. This challenges the dominant conceptual grammar of security that treats
insecurities as unavoidable facts while focusing attention onto
the acquisition of security by given entities. It foregrounds the
processes through which something or someone (the Other) is
discursively produced as a source of insecurity against which the
Self needs to be secured. Thus, discourses of insecurity are about

“representations of danger” (Campbell 1998). Insecurities, in
this view, are social constructions rather than givens—threats
do not just exist out there, but have to be created. All insecurities are culturally produced in the sense that they are produced
in and out of “the context within which people give meanings
to their actions and experiences and make sense of their lives”
(Tomlinson, in Weldes et al. 1999: 1). Insecurities and the objects
that suffer from insecurities are mutually constituted. That is,
in contrast to the received view, which treats objects of security and insecurity themselves as pre-given and natural and as
separate things, I treat them as mutually constituted cultural and
social constructions and thus, products of processes of identity
construction of Self-Other. The argument that security is about
representations of danger and social construction of the Self and
the Other does not imply that there are no “real” effects. What
it means is that there is nothing inherent in any act, or being, or
object that makes it a source of insecurity and danger.
Security is linked closely with identity politics. How we
define ourselves depends on how we represent others. This
representation is thus integrally linked with how we “secure”
ourselves against the Other. Representations of the Other as
a source of danger to the security of the Self in conventional
understandings of security are accompanied by an abstraction,
dehumanization, depersonalization, and stereotyping of the
Other. The Other gets reduced to being a danger and hence an
object that is fit for surveillance, control, policing, and possibly
extermination (cf. Foucault 1977, 1988). This logic of the discourse of security dictates that the security of the Self facilitate
and even demand the use of policing and violence against the
Other.
Hindu nationalism can be conceptualized as a discourse of
security, yet it feeds insecurity into society. As pointed out earlier,
according to Hindutva, the minority Others, in alliance with secularists and communists, are waging a war against the Hindus.
The stereotyped Muslim figure is represented as a danger to
Hindu security at different levels—individual Hindu (especially
female) bodies, Hindu neighborhoods, Hindu India, as well as
the entire world. These representations of minorities as a danger

to the security of the Hindu body politic facilitate the politics of
hate against Muslims in India. In the face of such hostile foreign
religionists, Hindutva prescribes a multipronged approach—a
propaganda warfare to “reveal” (in practice, manufacture) the
conspiracy of minorities and their secular allies to fool Hindus
into believing that there is no danger; sociocultural mobilization
of Hindus so that they are proud of their unified Hindutva identity; political organization of Hindus to ensure that they form a
vote bank; capturing the state to reflect the Hindutva interests;
and using violence against minorities in the name of securing the
Hindu body politic. The aim is to create a potent Hindu nation.
Challenges of Democracy
It is tempting to view Hindu nationalism primarily as a political
movement and, therefore, lament or celebrate (depending on
one’s views) its limited influence on Indian democracy. The fact
that Hindu nationalists have never won more than a minority
share of Hindu votes or that Hindutva-based parties such as the
BJP have had to moderate their views for reasons of governance
does not imply a serious setback for Hindu nationalism. The
idea of Hindutva remains unsullied for many of its subscribers.
The BJP’s defeat is perceived with the same old lens—an unholy
alliance of minorities and opportunist secularists (led by a foreign-born woman, Sonia Gandhi); unawakened and divided
Hindus; and a Hindutva party that has gone against its principles. Varun Gandhi’s incendiary speech in 2009 or Narendra
Modi’s hate speeches in 2002 may have contributed to the BJP’s
problems and losses, but it certainly brought a thumping victory in the targeted locales. Such politics of hate clearly worked
for Narendra Modi’s party in Gujarat and Varun Gandhi in
Pilibhit constituency.
Like other religious fundamentalisms, Hindutva has a bigger goal of socio-politico-cultural transformation. Setbacks
in elections are seen as peripheral to the long-term vision of a
Hindu Rashtra—after all, in a narrative of a continuous war of
hostile religious groups for more than a millennium, a decade
of setbacks is not a big deal.

Hindutva as a social and cultural project remains active
and thriving. RSS’s shakha activities continue uninterrupted;
Hindutva ideologues adapt their ideas to suit the tastes of Non
Resident Indians (e.g., linking Hindutva’s cause with that of
Zionists or toning down the Swadeshi agenda) and urban middle classes (e.g., through Online Shakha); the VHP adopts the
Internet for its agenda; and the Bajrang Dal utilizes new technologies for spreading intolerance. Hindu nationalism is here to
stay in the Indian landscape. While acting as a defender of faith
and culture, Hindutva in practice intervenes in both, and seeks
to transform them from fluid, diverse, highly contested entities
to ones that can be mobilized for Hindu nationalist purposes.
More research is needed on the myriad ways in which Hindutva
scavenges upon existing religious and cultural practices, shapes
the commonsense of a wider Hindu population, transforms
what it means to be a “Hindu,” and selectively appropriates ideas
of secularism, democracy, rights, equality, and security for its
own long-term agenda of establishing a Hindu India.
The disjuncture between the imagined militarized Hindu
nation and the actual fact of a rich plurality of Hindu society
turns the rage of Hindutva against the Hindus themselves. The
Hindu nation becomes a rarefied ideal, which only the Sangh
Parivar and its sympathizers are capable of appreciating. Other
Hindus, under the spell of anti-Hindu ideas of secularism,
communism, “Macaulayism,” Westernization, women’s emancipation, and even democracy, are criticized for being ignorant.
Hindu nationalists speak of secularism and democratic
rights (see also Hansen 1999 and Ludden 1996) with a forked
tongue. They reject the mainstream version of secularism as
appeasement of minorities and as pseudo-secularism. They
argue that a genuine democracy should recognize the primacy
of the Hindu majority and give no special protection or rights
for the minorities. But the same Hindu nationalists will also
reject secularism as alien (only Hindu sanatana dharma is
“true secularism”), claim that the celebration of the diversity of
Indian culture is a conspiracy to erase the essential oneness of
India as expressed in sanatana dharma, promote Hinduization
of public life, appeal to Islamophobic Western ideologues to

support their case, criticize state measures to promote equality
(such as the right of daughters to have a share in paternal property) and progressive social and environmental movements as
anti-family, and express intolerance of dissident views by beating up artists, writers, and activists.
Hindutva’s relationship with politics is one of a convenient
split. The dominant self-image is of an apolitical cultural
nationalism that despises the “dirty” realm of politics and is
primarily interested in a regeneration of Hindu society, protection of Hindu religion and culture, and establishing of a Hindu
Rashtra in India. For instance, in a resolution passed by the
VHP, which is the primary Hindutva organization that politicizes the Hindu religion, at the Akhila Bharatha Mutt-Mandir
Conference (All India Mutt-Mandir Conference) held on 12
and 13 November 2005 in Hyderabad (the VHP uses the name
Bhagyanagar to de-Islamize the place) a call was made for
keeping temples and monasteries out of secular government
control; the conference resolved that the temple’s management
should not acquire an “overt or covert hue” (Akhila Bharatha
2005). The RSS’s vision of a Hindu nation is presented as
primordial and beyond the vagaries of everyday politics,
“Whether some people accept and recognise it or not due to
their ignorance, Hindu Rashtra exists, it has been existing for
ages and it shall continue to exist for ever. Thus Hindu Rashtra
is not a political concept but a cultural and emotional one,
eternally asserting itself ” (Rao in Seshadri et al. 1990). Politics
is usually presented as a regrettable necessity, which Hindu
nationalists have to indulge in to protect dharma, samaj, sanskriti and sabhyata.
This seeming split of the political and the cultural domain
allows the RSS to selectively embrace or distance itself from
other members of the Parivar and adopt a sanctimonious role
of being “above politics.” If there is an outcry over the Bajrang
Dal’s hooliganism, the RSS would claim that it has nothing to
do with them. At the same time, the distinction between the
RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, and so on is highly blurred and the
personnel shift between these. “The Rashtriya Swayamsevak
Sangh works only for organising the society and man-making

and individuals (Swayam sevaks) fired by that very passion take
the message of the Sangh to various areas of national life, make
people from those areas their associates, and work together
for realising the ultimate goal of national prosperity. The sole
objective is to make the nation most glorious of all and a world
leader” (Bajpai and Barthawal 2001: 28).
Democracy is not only about majority rule and minority
rights, but also a political culture that allows for expressions of
dissent without fear. Hindu nationalism has limited tolerance
of dissent, resents minority rights, and only focuses on majority
rule. But its understanding of the principle of majority rule goes
against the very principle of liberal democracy—democratic
majority is a political majority (the composition of which
changes all the time) and not an identity-based majority. By
investing the numerical Hindu majority with a political agency,
Hindu nationalism seeks to make Indian democracy illiberal
and authoritarian. The only “rights” that Hindutva struggles for
are those of Hindu nationalists to stamp their mark on the society, culture, and politics of India. Otherwise, “rights talk” (where
individuals make a claim against the collective, or religious or
sexual minorities demand a recognition of their difference, or
hitherto oppressed groups struggle for justice) is viewed as promoting individualism and tensions within an otherwise pristine,
family-based Hindu/Indian society.
Hindu nationalism’s politics of fear and imagination implies
that it is a serious attack on the ideas and practices of secularism, unity in diversity, and democracy in India. A Hindu
nationalist India may become a militarily stronger country, but
it certainly will not be the country Indians had fought for during the anticolonial struggle. The Hindutva’s project of Hindu
India militates not only against religious minorities and dissenters, but seeks to create a new ahistorical and deracinated
India where secular democracy becomes an empty signifier.

Appendix I

Islam X-Rayed
Prepared by
A Board of Experts on Islam
Published by:
Rashtra Chetna Prakashan & Charitable Trust
(Ahmedabad, Gujarat)

Introduction
Islam is only a 1400 year old religion. But within such a short period it
has spread over most of the parts of the world and today this religion has
around 135 billion followers [sic]. Unlike other religions, Islam has not
undergone any theological reform or evolution since Islam is intrinsically
anti-reformation. Viewed from the historical perspective, Islam portrays
itself as a vigorously confrontationist doctrine—confrontationist both,
on theological as well as material premises. . . .

Purpose of this literature
This literature is not a textbook on Islamic theology, but in a true
sense, is a training manual with a specific purpose. A very famous
“Kafir” scholar of Islamic theology once remarked that, “The strength
of Allah lies in the non-Muslims’ ignorance of the contents of Islamic
theology which shapes the Psyche of the Islamic world.” Nothing
can be truer than that, and that explains the purpose of this training manual. The main purpose of this training manual is to create a
group of non-Muslim experts on Islamic theology in order to expose

Islam to the non-Muslim masses and demolish the myth of “religion
of peace” as Islam as generally misportrayed by the secularist agents
of Islam.
Now a question is likely to arise that why we Hindus should take the
trouble of exposing Islam. The answer is that the non-Muslim world
must know the root and the mechanism of Islamic terrorism; then
only we shall be able to formulate a counter-strategy to fight Islamic
terrorism. We are often told that Muslims are peace-loving people and
only the terrorists are misinterpreting Islam, but if we study Islamic
theology, we shall know for certain that there is nothing called peaceloving Muslim or terrorist Muslim, rather whoever believes in the
Quran and Hadiths are either real terrorists or potential terrorists
and all those people who believe in Islam cherish a single desire in
their hearts: destruction of all non-Muslims and Islamizing the whole
world. Understanding this is important in two accounts. First, if we
understand that terrorism is intrinsic to Islamic religion, we will be
able to make aware the so far unaware non-Muslims regarding the
same and build up resistance to Islamic terror and take pre-emptive
measures to eradicate it. Secondly, when we understand Islam properly, we shall be able to counter and neutralize those secularists who
preach in favor and expose them in public. To be precise, to eradicate
a certain threat to our existence, we must first have the proper threatperception and without understanding as well as exposing Islam to
the non-Muslim masses, we cannot make the masses aware of what
danger Islam poses for their very existence.
This “Training Manual” is divided into three broad parts, each
of which is again sub-divided into several Chapters. The first part
deals with the “theological Exposition of Islam.” The second part
deals with how secularists and the Muslim intellectuals try to defend
their theory that “Islam is a religion of peace.” So, in this part, a thorough guideline is provided as to how we should counter and demolish
each of their arguments in favor of Islam. The third part deals with
the “Strategy of creating awareness among the non-Muslims regarding the Islamic danger.” Along with this “Training Manual,” our activists are advised to go through the Quran and certain books on Islamic
theology and history, which are listed. It must be zealously remembered and followed for all times that this “Training Manual” is not
meant for the general public. It is specifically for the people who have
resolved to shoulder the job of exposing Islam as a mission of life.
Each copy of this Training Manual has a separate code-number. The
activist to whom a copy of this “Training Manual” is allotted must

he may be, for even a very short period or photocopying the same
is strictly prohibited and any such act shall be considered a serious
breach of organizational discipline for which the concerned activist
shall be held liable and answerable. The reader must go through this
“Training Manual” with utmost sincerity and thoroughness and must
achieve a complete grip over this subject before taking it to the public.
In each and every session/debate on this particular subject, activists
are instructed to carry a copy of the Quran for ready reference and
demonstration.

Chapter 1
The Key-words of Islam
To understand and expose Islam, one must study and analyze it in the
light of the “Quran” and the “Hadiths” as well as the history of the
development of Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad, the Prophet
of Islam . . .
Chapter 2
Allah
Allah is the only god of Islam. . . . So whatever the secularists say
about “Islamic tolerance of their religions” and Gandhian delirium of
“Ishwar Allah tere naam” are nothing but a hoax and a ploy to mislead
the Hindus . . .
Exercise:
[i] Prove that Allah is the only god to be worshipped and the Gods
of other religions are to be condemned . . .
[ii] Prove that only believing in Allah is not enough, and to be a true
Muslim one has to condemn and destroy other religions also . . .

and try to finish all other religions. Hint: Sura 109; 3/19, 85;

Kafir

3/28: Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to believers. Whose death that hath no connection with Allah
unless (it be) that ye but guard ourselves against them, taking (as it
were) security. Allah biddeth you beware (only) of Himself. Unto
Allah is the journeying (Md. Pickthal).
This ayat is extremely important for understanding the behaviourpattern of the Muslims living in a non-Muslim country. The above
ayat says that a Muslim should not make friends with the nonMuslims and such is permissible only when the Muslims feel that
antagonizing the non-Muslims will risk their security. In India as well
as other countries where the Muslims are the minority, we see that
sometimes they behave in a friendly manner with the non-Muslims
and take part in the social and political activities with the non-Muslim
majority community. For example we have Muslims in all the political
parties in India who are, in a concerted manner, furthering the cause
of Islam, taking advantage of the secularist myopia of our countrymen. In general, whenever a Muslim pretends to be friendly with the
non-Muslims, these the non-Muslims take as a sincere gesture and
ignore their threat from the Muslims. The Muslims take advantage
of our ignorance and consolidate their strength. The Muslims sometimes make friends with the non-Muslims to use them for their own
purpose and when the purpose is served or the Muslim gets an upperhand, the real Islam in them comes out (30–31) . . .
33/59 O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women
of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go
abroad). That will be better, so that they may be recognised and not
annoyed. Allah is ever forgiving, merciful (Md. Pickthal).
In this ayat, Allah is asking the Muslim women to put on “Burqa”
as an identification mark so that the Muslim males can recognize

them as Muslim women and do not molest them. So Allah provides
immunity from molestation to the Muslim women only . . . Further
this ayat shows that Allah does not hold molestation as an offence in
general and if a Muslim molests a non-Muslim woman that is not
Allah’s lookout . . . This verse not only shows the partisan attitude of
Allah but also gives the Muslim males a permanent license to molest
the non-Muslim women.

Chapter 7
ZAKAT
How all the Muslims sponsor terrorism
The main objective of this instant chapter is to show how all the
Muslims of the world consciously support and sponsor terrorism . . .
(The obligatory nature of zakat, the limitation of compassion and
Islamic charity only for the Muslims, and the prescription of jihad as
a higher form of service than zakat, ensures that most of zakat goes
for militant Islamic objectives).
So it can be quite comfortably inferred that all the Muslims around
the world pay “Zakat” willingly and knowing fully well that such
money is going to be used for terrorism as per their religious scripture. So, in other words, it is the common Muslims who consciously
fund the Islamic terrorists as a religious duty and service to Allah . . .
So it is not only some Islamic charity and financial organizations, but
the whole Muslim world is responsible for financing Islamic terrorism
against the non-Muslims.
Chapter 8
Shahada
...
(Establishes that only Muslims can be shahid and that too by getting killed in a battle against the non-Muslims—Jihad and therefore
Bhagat Singh cannot be called Shahid).
We must remember that calling all the worthy sons of Bharat Mata
by the adjective of Shahid is the worst possible insult to their sacred
souls and immortal inspirations. Calling them Shahid amounts to
reducing them to the level of a sectarian, narrow-minded religious
fanatic and a mindless sub-human who believed that by killing, raping and converting other people to Islam, they can go to paradise and
sip grape-juice sitting on the lap of virgins with high bosom.

Part—2
Chapter 9
How to Handle a Secularist/Muslim Intellectual in a Public Debate:
To learn how to handle the secularists and the Muslim intellectuals,
we must first know how they behave in public debates.
First they will say whatever they have to say. Then when your turn
comes, they will keep interrupting you and keep talking over you
(example: Sitaram Yechury). When they are cornered, they will skip
the issue. When they are incapable of answering a particular question,
they will say that they don’t feel that question/issue to be relevant
(example: Sahabuddin).
Antidotes for the Secularist Bugs:
(1) When you are in a public debate with the secularist/Muslim
intellectuals, do not be polite to them, because they will not
be polite to you. We have the chronic disease (‘Prithwiraj
Chauhan syndrome’) of showing unnecessary courtesy and
kindness to our adversaries. Just keep one thing in mind: Our
aim is not to strike a personal friendship with the secularists
of [or?] the Muslims, which is next to impossible. Our aim is
to expose them. Simply act with toughness.
(2) The secularists will try to irritate you, but you should keep
your cool. You should try to make the secularist/Muslim a
laughing stalk [sic] in front of the public around. This will
irritate him to your advantage.
(3) When in a debate, interact with the crowd. For example, when
you are showing a paper-cutting or the Quran in course of a
debate, hold it up towards the people and not to the secularists.
When you quote something or read out ayats of the Quran or
any related thing, face the public as if you are reading out to
them and not towards your opponent.
(4) Whenever a secularist or a Muslim intellectual says something
for which he/she does not show any reference, you can conveniently say that he/she is telling lies. This will further irritate him.
(5) If during your speech or reply, the secularist/Muslim intellectual tries to interrupt you or disturb you to the slightest
extent, tell him/her immediately (loudly and sternly enough so
that the people around can understand) that his/her behavior
is not civilized and he/she should behave properly. In spite of
that, if he/she continues to interrupt you, just keep speaking
and speak louder. And when the turn of the secularist comes,

you also disturb him/her in the similar manner. Remember one
thing: We are at propaganda war with the secularists/Muslim
intellectuals, and the only ethic of every war is victory.
Always be ready with some questions which you think the secularists cannot answer and at the very first opportunity, throw
the questions to (specifically) the crowd and then demand the
answer from your opponent. The secularist/Muslim will try
to bypass those questions saying that these are irrelevant but
you immediately assert that these are absolutely relevant and
the secularist/Muslim is not answering it just because they are
not intellectually honest and capable of answering the same.
In case they give a wrong answer, you immediately give your
answer (to the crowd) and say that he/she is lying.
Example: Common civil code, polygamy by the Muslims.
Also ask them whether they have read Quran. They will say
yes, then you immediately ask which translation, which publication. You quote ayats from the Quran and ask them what
they feel about it (example: 3/151; 8/12; 9/5; 5/14, 51; 3/85;
4/48 etc.). You can also ask them other issues; like they are so
obsessed with the Muslim refugee camps in Gujarat, but they
never mentioned the Hindu refugee camps there. Also raise the
issue of Kashmiri Hindu refugees.
In any debate, always be in an attacking mood and never be
apologetic for anything whatsoever. Put as many embarrassing
questions as possible to the secularist/Muslim.
Whenever you go for a debate with the secularists/Muslims,
always be ready with the basic materials you want to rely on
and carry the same along with you and display the same to
the public. This will create tremendous positive impact on the
audience.
There is another bad habit we have to shake off. Whenever the
secularists call us “communal,” we become defensive and try to
establish that we are not communal, rather they are pseudosecularists. This defence-mechanism in our arguments give the
secularists an upper-hand. We need not and should not take
trouble to prove who are real secularists and who are pseudosecularists. Our objective should be to make the secularists
objects of public condemnation and ridicule.

So, whenever they call us communal, you assert that you are communal because you are concerned about the security and interest
of the Hindu community. The Christians and the Muslims openly

assert their communal issues and claims. The Christian leaders were
extremely vocal and assertive about their communal issues, i.e., right
to convert, murder of Graham Stains. The Muslims leaders do it
regarding “Babri.” They loud [sic] the plight of the Muslim refugees
at Gujarat. And the secularists also join them in these campaigns. So,
the Hindus should not feel shaky if the secularists call us “communal”
when we raise issues of Hindu interests. Rather we should attack them
in every public debate regarding their double-standards. Instead of
calling the secularists pseudo-secularists, we should directly and publicly accuse them as “agents of the Muslims.”
Chapter 10
Secularist Arguments and the Counter Arguments
...
Our primary objective is to spread awareness about the real nature of
Islam among the non-Muslim masses. So our whole effort and energy
are desired to be channeled to expose Islam to the non-Muslim masses.
It will be wiser not to waste much energy in convincing the
Secularists about the real nature or [of?] Islam, since these people are
either politically motivated or simply bribed by the Islamic forces for
supporting their causes. So we should not waste our time in private
discussion with the secularists . . .
(6) The secularist may say that some people are misinterpreting
Islam. Immediately ask him among all religions why only Islam is so
vulnerable to misinterpretation?
Then face the audience and tell them that there are 140 billion
Muslims [sic] in the world. If only 1% of them, i.e., 1 crore 40 lakhs
of Muslims misinterpret Islam. Now only 18 misinterpreters of Islam
destroyed the WTC, then what havoc these 1 crore 40 lakhs of misinterpreters of Islam can do? Again the total military strength of all the
non-Muslim nations taken together is less than 1 crore 40 lakhs . . .

Chapter 11
The Methodology for Campaign
When you plan to expose Islam, you must prepare yourself
thoroughly . . .
(Read previous parts, including theology, observations on Islam made
by Aurobindo, Vivekananda and Ambedkar, keep a copy of Quran,
and do more research).

You will find repetitions of important ayats and some topics in
different Chapters but don’t be impatient with that. We have kept the
repetitions purposefully to help you to memorize the important topics. Also remember that the Quran is full of repetitions and you will
have to encounter similar ayats in all possible angles.
Now first discuss the matter with your co-workers and practice
[sic] how to deliver speech in public and place your theories in any
debate or discussion. Learning some key Arabic words and Muslim
customs shall be extremely helpful.
Equip yourself
Always carry a copy of The Quran, thoroughly underlined and
indexed properly (for your own reference). Always carry the quotations of the great Indians which are given in Appendix. And never
forget to carry your self-defence equipment.
How to choose audience?
Your audience may be a single person or a group. Do not preach this to
anybody who is below 14 years of age, unless you are an expert to deal
with the minors because that may be counter-productive. Do not waste
your time to convince a Communist, a Muslim or any other known antiHindu person. Remember our goal is to create awareness among the
vast population of Hindus who have no knowledge of Islamic theology
though they are aware of the atrocities committed by the Muslims. So,
instead of wasting your time to convince these professional secularists
or anti-Hindu persons, your objective should be to expose them as liars
and turn the public opinion against these people. So instead of engaging in personal debates with a secularist or a Muslim or a Communist,
we must place them in a crowd of impartial people and handle them
and expose them through logic in front of the general public.
First you spread awareness among the people who are pro-Hindu
but do not have much knowledge of Islam. By doing this you should
be able to form your own group for campaign in this particular
subject.
Now when you have formed such group of persons; then speak
before the mass whom you think somewhat indifferent in that particular issue. In such debate when you are speaking, the members
of your group should remain as audience but should play the role
of a “supporting, encouraging and approving crowd.” This makes a
tremendous psychological effect on the audience. When the common
people see that there are people already endorsing the view of the

speaker, they tend to get easily convinced and unanimous with the
speaker. This is the way mass psychology works.
Finally, when you spread the message among a somewhat sizable
portion of the common masses and you have achieved somewhat
social approval of what you are preaching, then concentrate on the
secularists/Communists/Muslims.
Solitary audience
Before you choose a person to teach Islam, know the circumstance,
whether it is in a bus or a train, a house or a lonely street or park.
Try to understand if that person is Hindu or Christian or Muslim
or Communist. Avoid Muslims and Communists if they do not start
talking about Islam.
Instead of starting a discussion about Islam yourself, create a
context/mood so that the person is provoked to make some comments on Islam or Muslims. If you are traveling with a friend, start
discussing some current news involving the Muslims; may it be some
riot, war against terrorism, some terrorist activity anywhere, anything regarding Pakistan, Bangladesh or anything that may provoke
the co-passenger(s) or people around them to make any comment.
If anybody makes such comments, do not jump to your point. Let
him talk for a whole [while?] and passively agree with him (if not
too objectionable) to win his confidence. Then gradually draw him
into a solid discussion about Islam. But always let that person express
his/her ideas first and you try to understand his/her understanding
and political views also. If he praises Islam, then ask him whether he
has read Quran. If he typically says he has read, then ask him which
translation of the Quran he has read. Then directly quote 9/5, 4/24,
8/12 etc. and ask his opinion. If he tries to defend the Quran, then
apply the methods which we have elaborated in Part—2 to break his
defences. If he is stubborn, then do not waste your time on him; but
if there are other people around who, you find, are taking interest in
your conversation, then you continue to quote the most explicit and
dangerous ayats of the Quran so that they can hear you. There must
be many people around who will listen to you with great interest, but
are not bold enough to appreciate you. If the people are silent but
attentive, you know that your lecture is not going into vain.
If anyone challenges you then show him the underlined Quran. If
anyone calls you communalist, then ask him whether he thinks Swami
Vivekananda, Amdebdkar or Sri Aurobindo were communal. Then
quote these people. This will shut your opponent up. If the audience

is receptive and appreciating, then gradually intensify your lecture.
Tell people at the first opportunity that Islam is getting exposed
throughout the world, more particularly in the U.S. and Europe.
Always carry some low-priced booklets on Islam so that you can sell
them to anyone who is interested. That booklet will help to convince
him further.
Talking to a group
While talking to a single person, many people often start participating and a discussion group may be formed automatically. In such
case you should assess the mood of the people around. Often you will
be invited to discuss Islam to a group. In that case, first you should
enquire about the identity (religious and ideological) of that particular group. Then assess the age-group. educational level and languagepreference of that group.
Do not say whether Islam is good or bad. Rather you tell them
what are the injunctions of the Quran and what are the implications of such injunctions on us. Always carry your copy of the Quran
and other materials and show it to the people and read out from
there. Then quote what some great men commented about Islam,
Remember, no matter how well you speak people will be ultimately
convinced by quotes of these great men. Let the people form their
own opinion. Do not say Islam is bad, rather say all the bad things
which are there in the Quran and do not forget to tell your audience
that Quran is a mandatory code of conduct for all Muslims and it
is absolutely unchangeable. Do not give a unilateral lecture, invite
response from your audience, encourage interactions. You do not
suggest the remedies to the Islamic problem, rather let your audience
suggest it. If people ask you about the remedy, you tell them first we
should understand the root of the problem and make others understand the same, then the remedy will automatically evolve. You can
also ask your audience what should be the remedy they think. Another
thing you should build up in the course of your speech: i.e. you have
to build up a threat-perception in the minds of the people regarding
“Jihad.” That is to be done by citing examples of Islamic excesses from
recent as well as historical incidents.
The rule of Thumb: do not say Islam is good, bad or ugly. Only
state clearly (from Quran) what Islam says about the people of other
religions and what is the effect of Islam on the non-Muslims. Leave
the judgement on the people who are intelligent enough. Always carry
with you small and cheap booklets which contain somewhat a gist of

the theological exposition of Islam and ayats from the Quran for sale
and/or distribution. If a person is interested, he will take a copy and
through him some more people can get to read the same literatures
[sic]. When talking of Islam, always demonstrate the Quran whenever
you quote an ayat.
How to encounter a pro-Muslim dalit?
Do not talk directly on Islam. Talk about BabasaheebAmbedkar. Let
him first commit that he respects Ambedkarji and has absolute faith
in him. When he says yes, show him what BabasaheebAmbedkar
has said regarding Islam and the Muslims. That will be a sufficient
medicine. In this regard one book is extremely useful—“Pakistan or
the partition of India” by Ambedkarji. You are advised to possess a
copy of this book. However, the quotations of Ambedkarji are given
here in
Appendix II
How to encounter a Communist?
Ask a Communist (always before the general public) whether he is
atheist. If he claims to be atheist then remind him according to their
own definition Kafir means atheist. So he (all communists) is the most
endangered species so far as “Jihad against the Kafirs” are concerned.
Then ask him why the “muslim umma” of the world fought for destroying the Communist regime in Afghanistan in the Soviet era?
How to encounter a secularist?
Simply tell him (always in front of the public): “Well, he is so fond of
the Muslims, but when a riot will break up, will they identify him and
spare him? Will they remember that he betrayed his own community
and allied with them or they will simply slit his throat and rape his
wife and daughter for the fault of being Hindus?” Ask him whether he
remembers what exactly happened to Raja Jaichand who was exactly
as secular and pro-Muslim like him. (Remember that though the
secularist fellow sitting opposite you is the focus of the these questions, you should throw these questions in such a manner [as] if you
are asking the same to the public. Interact with the crowd always to
expose and heckle a secularist.
Then tell the crowd that wherever and whenever the Muslims
grabbed the state-power, they could manage to do it even though they
were in a minority in that country. They never need to grab, become

majority to grab the state-power. Then with help from a group of
majority community to grab the power and after grabbing the power,
immediately slaughter their secularist allies. Again cite the example
of Jaichand.
How to encounter a Muslim?
Always avoid arguing with the Muslims because it will be absolutely
unproductive and utter wastage of time. You should do so only if
there is a Hindu audience around you and you can expose the Muslim
before them. To have a public debate with a Muslim, you must take aid
specifically from the Chapter on Jihad and Kafir.
Ask the Muslim (and also your audience) why all the terrorists are
claiming to be inspired by the Quran? If he says that the terrorists are
misinterpreting the Quran; you ask him why among all the religious
scriptures, only the Quran is being so often misinterpreted? Ask him
if the Muslim terrorists are doing anything un-Islamic then why the
Muslim leaders are not declaring them as anti-Muslim and holding a
price over their head? Ask the Muslim why he is reluctant to implement the criminal sharia laws of amputating hands for theft, etc.?
Why he only sticks to Jihad and polygamy as the sole Islamic law? . . .
If you encounter a Muslim woman, ask her, what she will get in
heaven while her husband will get 72 houries and 28 boys?
How to encounter the people who say all religions are equally bad?
To encounter this you need a special training of comparative religion: But in brief, you can ask him where in the Hindu religion it is
ordained to kill all non-believers as ordained in the Quran.
How to encounter the people who say “Don’t bother about religion?”
Ask him, as India is divided on religious basis, two kinds of law are
there in country how you can leave religion aside? Use the guideline
given in “True Face of Islam.”
How to encounter the people who say “know your religion, don’t
criticize others’ religion?”
You will encounter many such people among the Hindutvawadis.
These people always discouraged discussion about Islam, even in the
Hindu organizations. Handle them carefully and vigorously.
Tell them, “Yes, we know our religions, but still why we could
not prevent 1000 years of slavery? So it indicates that only knowing
my religion is not enough. You must know the philosophy of your

rivals and who and why some people want to kill us, loot us, rape
us?” Simply ask him the reasons why a vast majority of Hindus were
enslaved under a handful of foreign invaders.
How to encounter the people who say all Muslims do not believe in
Terrorism?
See the detailed guideline given in “True Face of Islam.”
How to convince family and relative?
In fact this is your main job and challenge that you will not leave family members and relatives “unconvinced about the terrorist nature of
Islam.”
Until and unless you can convince the family members, you cannot
function as a preacher properly. So concentrate on this. You will get
ample time and scope for this. You have to find your own way, especially if your spouse is a pro-Muslim person. In family always behave
in a matured way so that you can establish credibility and assure
them that you will not do anything that can jeopardize the security
and economic interest of the family. Always be watchful about your
servants, in case they are agents of anti-Hindu forces having too many
outside contacts. Always make sure that all your employees are true
Hindus. Remember that danger usually comes from unloyal or anti
Hindu employees.
What you will do if somebody becomes angry and aggressive
towards you. On the first hand, you should scan the people around
to avoid such circumstances. If the aggressive person is Hindu, then
tell him, “look, you and me both are Hindus, but you can not tolerate my option, how could you expect that there will be unity among
Hindus and Muslims, while you as a Hindu, even can not tolerate
a Hindu?” Also say “What I am saying was told by Risi Aurobindo,
Swami Vivekananda and Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who was the author
of our constitution. First deal with them.”
If the person is a Muslim, tell him. “You can kill me, but that will
not solve your problem, hundreds of thousands of non-Muslims
have already read the Quran, how many people you can kill? If you
consider yourself a true Muslim, then start a movement to demand
Islamic criminal laws, let me see you courage them come to me.” See
the guideline in “True face of Islam.”
